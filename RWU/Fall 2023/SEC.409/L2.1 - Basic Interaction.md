# L2.1 - Basic Interaction

### Echo options
- It is possible to have echo act as a tool to prompt users
- Two possible options can be used for this
	- `-n` is used to suppress any line feed which means it would look like 
		- `Echo -n "What is this"
		- So there is no line feed at the end
	- `-e` is an alert to the echo that an escape character is to be used at the end
		- `Echo -e "What is this? \c"`
			- The `\c` also suppresses the line feed 

### Read can then be used
- Read is an option which pauses for input
- Read pushes a response into the variable $REPLY
- `Echo -n "What is your name?"`
- `Read`
- `Echo "You replied $REPLY"`
	- would print whatever they typed after the question

#### Read on it's owm
- It's far easier to just manipulate the read variable directly
- `Read -p "What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?" airspeed`
	- This puts the response into $airspeed (and these are case sensitive)
	- If you leave it blank, it still goes into $REPLY

### Controlling inputs
- Abandon all hope, ye who enter here
- So, as you may guess, scripts are not always the most effective at control
- Input validation issues are common security flaws and one of the oldest hacks in the world
	- Blanks
	- Overflows
	- esc chars
	- You name it

- Read has an option (n) which can limit how much they can type
	- `Read -n1 "would you like another" resp`
	- Means they can only type one byte there. Of course they can still type just about anything
