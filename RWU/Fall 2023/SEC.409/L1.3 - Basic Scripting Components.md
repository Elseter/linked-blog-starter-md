# L1.3 - Basic Scripting Components
---
## Basic Scripts
### Arguments
- For BASH you can append arguments to the script call and then use those values in the script
- Arguments are listed during the call and are whitespace delimited
- Arguments are reference in scripts via their position on the call line starting with $1
	- $0 is the script name
	- If you have a lot of arguments, multidigit args must have curly braces around them
	- $# returns the number of arguments
	- $* is all of the arguments
- So essentially
	- ./showMe.sh Madame Arugula
	- Echo $1 == Madame
	- Echo $2 == Arugula
### Quotes
- Strings are always a mess
- Typically double quotes indicate a string
- But strings may contain literals and variables
- Echo "Mt name is: $1"
	- Prints my name is: Mudd
- But 'My name is: $1'
	- Prints My name is: $1
- A backslash will protect the $ for something like "the price is \\$10"
	- the price is $10
### Variables
- BASH has a full featured ability to use variables 
	- User-Defined - typical
	- Environment - these are system variables like $PATH
		- Hence, be careful with your vars

- Much like Python, interpreted variables are all heap allocations and don't really have typing per se.
	- Use a "get" = (equal sign) to assign a value to a name
	- To use the var put a $ before its name to output the value contained in the pointer
	- ==Do not use spaces in the assignment==
		- x=10 not x = 10
### Arrays
- Yep. they have them
- Vectors (single dimensional arrays) are created just by putting a list in curly brackets
	- vectorMe={0,1,1,2,3,5,8}
- To access a vector square brackets are used to pick an element
	- `Echo ${vectorMe[3]}` prints out 2
	- `Echo ${vectorMe[*]}` would print the entire array
	- += can be used to append a new element
	- Unset can be used to delete an element
>[! Note] Note
>Arrays are tricky. There are many syntax elements that can cause strange behavior's in manipulations of arrays
>- Bash doesn't really support multi-dimensional arrays. Honestly at that point, just use python or compile in C
### Scoping
- All vars are global in BASH
- This is terrifying. But it means that if you are writing BASH scripts for distribution and public consumption, you are probably used to fear
- If a script calls another script, the var will not be available since it is local to a given script
- So you can do another terrifying thing
	- Export mySecurityHole
		- This makes the var available in all running process, even ones someone else may be running
		- This is a dangerous practice for persistent tools
			- Don't do this
