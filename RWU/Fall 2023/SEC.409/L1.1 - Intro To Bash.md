# L1.1 - Intro To Bash
---
## Intro to Bash
- Notes from a video demonstration

### Your host
- Doug White
- PhD (Computer Information Systems and Quantitative Analysis)
- CCE (Certified Computer Engineer)
- CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Administrator)
- PI (RI) (Private Investigator, Rhode Island)
- First sysop job: PDP-11 1981
- Coding Intern: Fortran 1977

### BASH
- stands for Bourne Again Shell
	- basically this is a "virtual" environment that allows you to interact with the operating system
	- Bash is pretty much running on all Linux systems but there are others
		- Sh (original Bourne Shell) created at bell labs in the 1970's by Stephen Bourne
		- Korn Shell (ksh) is similar
		- Cshell (csh) is built using C and basically it was built for c programmers so they could use similar lingo in shell scripts to what they were doing with executables (tcsh is another of these that was modified later)

### Interpreted VS Compiled
- Compiled programs are just that, take the source code, process it through the linker to add all the libraries and then convert to binary. E.g C++
- Interpreted scripts are not compiled, they are just instructions in a file that are read one at a time
	- Very very slow compared to compiled

### Quick Hacking Interlude
- So this is an oldie that involves a script and Windows
	- In windows we have a .bat file which contains scripting code
	- We also have a $PATH variable which contains a list of directories that will be read in a specific order
	- So the first hack is to push some info into the path so the directory /foo appears before any other directory (this is usually done because the sys admins has no idea how to secure anything)

#### Big Note
- python is a scripting language as well
- BASH is more basic than python but it already installed (so is python on most linux servers) but a lot of the system type features, you would have to issue system calls with python so there is more overhead

#### Debian Linux
- Nammu.sec.rwu.edu is running Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
- But most versions of Linux at their BASH core is the same
- Many features of Linux distros may vary (like Yum vs apt) but the bash core is pretty much the same
- You are welcome to use any distro of your choice

##### Rules for nammu
- You may not access other students directories of files
- You may not attempt to "hack" or otherwise "explore" nammu. Stay in your own lane
- You may not give anyone else access to nammu
- You must use strong passwords
- Make backups of all of your work

##### General Rules
- You may not use CHAT-GPT to write your code. That kind of defeats the purpose
- You may be asked to explain any code you submit without warning
- You may not hire assistance
- You may not get copies of code from other students or other web sites
- You may not post your code or assignments to any websites besides bridges
