# L1.2 - Basic Bash

## Basic Bash
### $PATH
- $PATH is an environment variable
- It contains the hierarchical list of directories which will be examined in dynamic calls to commands
- Static calls do not invoke the path variable
	- You would need to specify the location
- Echo $PATH will display the current value of $PATH on the screen
- Echo $PATH > myPath.txt will put the values in a file
- Echo $PATH >> myPath.txt will append the value to a file
- Export PATH=$PATH will put the current directory on the end of the PATH

>[! bug] Note
>Its a good idea to back up defaults (such as PATH) prior to messing with values

#### $PATH Warnings
- Path is dangerous and can result in unexpected behavior's if you modify it
- Path can be used for hacking
- A command will not run dynamically if it is not in the path
- Static calls will run if the file exists

### Text Editors
- VIM - this is the typical hardcore editor
	- Hard to use but no one looks at you funny
	- Once you learn it, its fine
- Nano - tool for lesser beings
- In the end, you are editing a text file not trying to write a novel

#### Vim
- Typically the options for vim are in $HOME/.vimrc
	- Note a . in the file name. This makes it a hidden file
	- In ubuntu this file does not exist by default so you will need to make it
- Most people set:
	- Set showmode - displays insert mode
	- set nohlsearch - no highlight on word searched
	- set autoindent - you want this if you use indents
	- set tabstop=4 - size of a tab
	- Syntax on - highlights syntax

### First and Foremost
- Script files use .sh as an extension typically, but its not required
- Execution of script files is dangerous
	- Make backup copies before you do anything
	- Review before execute
	- In prod environments, well, don't do it, always test in dev never in prod
- Your script will require an absolute static string to execute
	- /home/dwhite/myFoo.sh
	- ./myFoo.sh - right here
- Your script will require the execute bit be set to on to run
	- This is the 1 in the 421 chmod (see next slide)

#### chmods
- Chmod permissions is a series of bits which are used to define some different permissions for files and directories in Linux
	- Each file has Owner/Group/Other and each field has 3 bits in it
	- By using different decimal values you can define permissions
		- 4 == read
		- 2 == write
		- 1 == execute
		- so read, write, execute is 7
		- Read, write is 6
		- Execute is 1
	- There are three fields for the owner, group, and other that each have a number 0-7
		- Hence the joke chmod 777*
		- Often for scripting and in a shared server you want all your files have 700 permissions but to execute you need at least 100 (execute only for the local user)
		- There is a video example
