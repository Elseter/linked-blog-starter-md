# L3.1 - More Linux
---
#### A31
- Hash collisions are the likelihood that two things have the same hash or ability to "spoof" a hash to mirror something else
- According to someone, the CBC algorithm just happens to match about 1/250th of the time
- This results in multiple methods of achieving a positive
	- So in this case, 0.00398% or 0.4% of the time

### Processes
- Processes are the running jobs on the linux system
- Every process has a PID which is used to identify it
- `ps` is the most common command and is usually run as:
	- `ps -ax` or `-auxww` this shows all the jobs and such that are running
		- `ps -auxww` shows the users of the jobs as well, which is kind of useful
	- It's not unusual to pipe the output or grep the output if you are looking for a specific task
	- It is also common to use awk to parse a pid number out of this data stream
		- awk can be used with most any stream and then allows the whitespace data to be referenced by columns

- The command `top` can be used as well which will show a live feed of the current processes and various stats about them. It updates automatically and remains up until you exit
- `>>` append
- `>` create
	- will overwrite an existing file if it exists

### Kill Signals
- You can send signals to jobs using the `kill -n <pid>`
	- Where n is the signal number (default is 15) and pid is the PID
	- `1 == sighup`, this is a kind of restart signal which asks the job reread it's conf and restart
	- `9 == sigkill,` this is an ungraceful termination which just basically "kills" the process via the OS
		- This is like turning off power to a device
		- 9 is a last resort
	- `15` is a sigterm
		- This sends a graceful exit to request to the PID. This is the recommended way to shut down a stray job
- You might need to be root to kill a job
- Be very very careful on production machines

#### Paranoia Notes
- A baseline is a really good idea at this point
- Maybe consider what your system normally looks like and compare it instead of seeing a new or different process and thinking you have been hacked
- But... if I were hacking you, I wouldn't name my processes, hey_dogu_you_sux(that's how they spelled it)
- I would name it FA001010_krnl_tsk_crit
- So you need to know your system

### Some thoughts on how to script that
- Even just a line count can be helpful
- diff is a command that will produce all the variations in two files
- So, even that is a mechanism but understand that the process list changes a lot all the time

- If you run a script with a & after it... it will run in the background
- `jobs -l` shows a list of background jobs
- `fg <pid>` brings background jobs to the foreground

#### Other Useful Commands
- `uname -a` this will show you the version of linux and kernel you are using
- `lsb_release -a` is more useful as it tells you specifically which distro you are using
- `Who` shows who is logged in
- `W` a better version pf who since it gives a lot more info about the users

##### Other Notes
- Understand the system times are usually in UTC which means you need to convert it. This can be particularly at issue with forensics
	- Part of our evidence log was the location where a server was and the time diff between utc and wherever that was
	- So, when I seized an image in Nanjing I had to check the time
		- `timedatectl` will show you a lot of info about this
		- In Nanjing t is UTC+8
### Date and time ops
- You really want your servers and such to be on correct time
- I have no issue with UTC and some people prefer it to time zone but it is all relative
- If you are using logs, and you are, you need to have correct info and not all products note the time zone when writing. This can get very confusing
- Date - simple command line date and time
- `timedatectl list-timezones` show the current timezones available
- `timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York` set the time zone to EST (EDT)

#### NTPD and timesyncd
- Network Time Protocol Daemon
	- This refers to the NTP operations in your network
- It is usually good to designate some system as "authoritative" for your network and sync everyone to that. I usually use the edge device since it is usually up and connected to the internet
- NTP protocol runs on port 123/tcp or udp
- Ubunut can also use timesyncd which is a similar product

##### Importance of Time
- Ensure your servers are synced before you even consider adding them to any sort of "cluster", "group", or "node"
