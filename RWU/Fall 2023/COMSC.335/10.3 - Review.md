# 10.3 - Review
---
### General Symbol Review
- $\cup$ - Union
- $\cap$ - Intersection
- $\subseteq$ - regular subset
- $\subset$ - Proper subset
- $\lnot A$ - Compliment
### Pumping Lemma
- $w = xyz$
	- $|w| \geq m$ 
	- $|xy| \leq m$
	- $|y| \geq 1$
- When picking a w for the pumping lemma
	- smallest y = 1
	- largest y = m
	- smallest x = 0
	- largest x = m-1
	- smallest z = $|w| - m$
	- largest z = $|w| - 1$
	- ==Pick a w that will break for any y==
### State Diagrams
- Looking right is insufficient
- IT HAS TO BE CORRECT
- Be sure to check every machine
