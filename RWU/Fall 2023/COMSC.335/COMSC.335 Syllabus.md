#### Course Description
Formal models of computation provide the framework for analyzing computing devices, with the goal of understanding the types of computations, which may be carried out on them. Finite and pushdown automata and the classes of languages, which they recognize, occupy the first part of the course. The remainder of the course addresses Turing Machines, Church's Thesis, undecidability, and algorithmic complexity
