## Operator Terminology
- Operands are the inputs to an operator, like 1 and 2 in the expression 1+2
	- Unary - One operand
	- Binary - two operands
	- Ternary - three operands
### Ternary Operator
- testCondition ? expression : expression 2
	- true - expression 1 executes
	- false - expression 2 executes
- The ternary operator takes three operands (condition, expression 1 and expression 2)
	- Hence the name, ternary operator

### More Operator Terminology
- In most programming languages, binary operators use an infix notation: a + b
	- written between two operands
- Sometimes you see prefix notation
	- before the two operands
