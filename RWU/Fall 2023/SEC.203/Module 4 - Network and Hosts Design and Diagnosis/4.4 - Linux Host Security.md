## 4.4.3 - Linux Host Security Facts
This lesson covers network security on Linux.

### Network Security on Linux
The following table describes the general procedures for increasing the network security of a Linux system:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Security Task|Procedure|
|Remove unnecessary software|Unnecessary software occupies disk space and could introduce security flaws. To remove unnecessary software:<br><br>1. Enter one of the following commands:<br><br>- **yum list installed** or **dnf list installed** to see installed RPM packages on the computer.<br>- **apt**<br>    - **apt autoremove** automatically removes unused packages<br>    - **apt list** list all installed packages<br>- **dpkg get-selections** to see installed Debian packages on the computer.<br><br>3. Research the function of any unrecognized package to determine if it is necessary.<br>4. Use one of the following commands to uninstall unnecessary packages.<br><br>- **yum erase _packagename_**<br>- **dnf remove _packagename_**<br>- **apt remove _packagename_**<br>- **rpm -e _packagename_**<br>- **dpkg -r _packagename_**|
|Check for unnecessary network services|Unnecessary network services waste computer resources and increase the system's attack service. To remove unnecessary network services:<br><br>1. Find all installed services and determine which are not needed:  DNS, SNMP, DHCP and others.<br><br>- **systemctl --type=service --state=active**<br><br>3. Use the **man** command and the Internet to research services you don't recognize.<br><br>- If the service is not needed, determine if it is a dependency for another service.<br><br>5. Disable the service by using the following command:<br><br>- **systemctl disable _servicename_**<br><br>7. Use one of the following commands to immediately stop the script:<br><br>- **systemctl stop _servicename_**<br><br>9. Use one of the following commands to remove the script package entirely.<br><br>- **yum erase _packagename_**<br>- **dnf remove _packagename_**<br>- **apt remove _packagename_**<br>- **rpm -e _packagename_**<br>- **dpkg -r _packagename_**|
|Locate open ports|Open ports can provide information about which operating system a computer uses. Also, they can provide entry points or information about ways to formulate an attack. To locate open ports:<br><br>1. Install the **nmap** utility if it is not already installed.<br><br>- **yum install nmap**<br>- **dnf install nmap**<br>- **apt -i nmap**<br><br>3. Use both of the following commands to scan for open ports:<br><br>- **nmap -sT** _ipaddress\|fqdn_ scans for TCP ports<br>- **nmap -sU** _ipaddress\|fqdn_ scans for UDP ports<br><br>5. Determine which services use the open ports.<br>6. Disable any unused service using the open ports information.  (_Make sure the service used is not a dependency for another service_).<br><br>- **systemctl disable _servicename_**<br>- **systemctl stop _servicename_**|
|Check network connections|Open network connections (open sockets) on a computer create a security risk. A _socket_ is an endpoint of a bi-directional communication flow across a computer network. Use the following **netstat** (network statistics) or **ss** (socket statistics) options to identify the open network connections on Linux systems:<br><br>- **-a** lists both listening and non-listening sockets.<br>- **-l** (_lowercase 'L'_) lists listening sockets.<br>- **-s** displays statistics for each protocol.<br>- **-i** displays a table of all network interfaces.|

## 4.4.5  -Configure iptables Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:
- Chains
- Actions performed
- Example iptables commands

### Chains
The Linux iptables firewall utility uses _policy chains_ (sets of rules) to allow or block network traffic. When a connection is initiated to your system, iptables looks for a matching rule. If it doesn't find one, it uses the default action in the tables. Be aware that iptables almost always comes pre-installed on any Linux distribution.

The filter table in iptables has three chains. The following table describes them.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Chain|Description|
|Input|This chain controls the behavior for incoming connections. For example, if a user attempts to ping the system, iptables attempts to match the IP address and port to a rule in the input chain.|
|Forward|This chain is used for packets leaving the system. These are incoming connections that aren't delivered locally. In other words, the traffic is not destined for the router; the router forwards the traffic to the destination device.|
|Output|This chain is used for outgoing connections. For example, if you ping testout.com, iptables checks its output chain to see what the rules are regarding ping and testout.com before allowing or denying the ping request.|

### Actions Performed
You can accept, drop, or reject the connections. After you define your accept rules, you should create a rule to drop all other traffic to prevent unauthorized access to the system.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Action|Result|
|Accept|Allows the connection.|
|Drop|Drops the connection. For example, an IP address in a rule with a drop action pings your system; the request is dropped. No response is sent to the user.|
|Reject|Rejects the connection, but will send a response back. This lets the sender know that the traffic reached a system, but was rejected.|

### Examples iptables Commands
The following table describes commands for iptables. Keep in mind that these are only a few examples; there are many more iptable commands.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Action|Command|
|List current rules|**sudo iptables -L**|
|Clear current rules|**sudo iptables -F**|
|Save iptables changes (Ubuntu)|**sudo /sbin/iptables-save**<br><br>The command may be different on other Linux systems.|
|Drop all incoming traffic|**sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP**|
|Block connections from 192.168.0.254|**sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.254 -j DROP**|
|Block SMTP mail on port 25|**sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -j REJECT**|
|Allow SMTP mail on port 25|**sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT  <br>sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 25 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT**|
|Allow HTTP traffic on port 80|**sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT  <br>sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT**<br><br>To allow HTTPS, you would use port 443.|
|Allow HTTP traffic on port  <br>Allow HTTPS traffic on port 443|**sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 80,443 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT  <br>sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 80,443 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT**|
