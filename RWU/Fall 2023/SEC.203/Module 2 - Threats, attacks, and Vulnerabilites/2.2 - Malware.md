## 2.2.2  - Malware Facts
Malicious code, known as malware, is a type of software designed to take over or damage a computer without the user's knowledge or approval.

This lesson covers the following topics:
- Malware examples
- Historic malware events

### Malware Examples
Examples of common malware attacks are described in the following table.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Attack|Characteristics|
|Fileless virus|A _fileless virus_ uses legitimate programs to infect a computer. Because it doesn’t rely on files, it leaves no footprint, making it undetectable by most antivirus, whitelisting, and other traditional endpoint security solutions. Fileless malware works in a similar way as a traditional virus, but it operates in memory. It never touches the hard drive. Attackers use social engineering schemes to get users to click a link in a phishing email. When the webpage opens, the virus gets into the inner recesses of a trusted application such as PowerShell or Windows script host executables.|
|Worm|A _worm_ is a self-replicating program. A worm:<br><br>- Does not require a host file to propagate.<br>- Automatically replicates itself without an activation mechanism. A worm can travel across computer networks without any user assistance.<br>- Infects one system and spreads to other systems on the network.|
|Trojan horse|A _Trojan horse_ is a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate or desirable software. A Trojan horse:<br><br>- Cannot replicate itself.<br>- Does not need to be attached to a host file.<br>- Often contains spying functions, such as a packet sniffer, or backdoor functions that allow a computer to be remotely controlled from the network.<br>- Often is hidden in useful software, such as screen savers or games. A _wrapper_ is a program that is used legitimately, but has a Trojan attached to it. The Trojan infiltrates the computer that runs the wrapper software.<br>- Relies on user decisions and actions to spread.|
|Zombie|A _zombie_ is a malware infected computer that allows remote software updates and control by a command and control center called a _zombie master_. A zombie:<br><br>- Is also known as a _bot_, short for robot.<br>- Commonly uses Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels, also known as _chat rooms),_ to communicate with the zombie master.<br>- Is frequently used to aid spammers.<br>- Is used to commit _click fraud_. The internet uses a form of advertising called _pay-per-click_, in which a developer of a website places clickable links for advertisers on the website. Each time the link is clicked, a charge is generated. Zombie computers can be used to commit click fraud by imitating a legitimate user clicking an ad.<br>- Is used for performing denial-of-service attacks.|
|Botnet|A _botnet_ refers to a group of zombie computers that are commanded from a central control infrastructure. A botnet:<br><br>- Operates under a command and control infrastructure where the zombie master (also known as the _bot herder)_ can send remote commands to order the bots to perform actions.<br>- Is detected through the use of firewall logs to determine if a computer may be acting as a zombie participating in external attacks.|
|Rootkit|A _rootkit_ is a set of programs that allows attackers to maintain permanent administrator-level, hidden access to a computer. A rootkit:<br><br>- Is almost invisible software.<br>- Resides below regular antivirus software detection.<br>- Requires administrator privileges to install and maintains those privileges to allow subsequent access.<br>- Is not always malicious.<br>- Often replaces operating system files with alternate versions that allow hidden access.|
|Logic bomb|A _logic bomb_ is designed to execute only under predefined conditions. It lies dormant until the predefined condition is met. A logic bomb:<br><br>- Uses a trigger activity such as a specific date and time, the launching of a specific program, or the processing of a specific type of activity.<br>- Does not self-replicate.<br>- Is also known as an _asynchronous_ attack.|
|Spyware|_Spyware_ is software that is installed without the user's consent or knowledge. It is designed to intercept or take partial control over the user's interaction with the computer. Spyware:<br><br>- Is installed on a machine when the user visits a particular web page or runs a particular application.<br>- Collects various types of personal information, such as internet surfing habits and passwords. It sends the information back to its originating source.<br>- Uses tracking cookies to collect and report a user's activities.<br>- Can interfere with user control of the computer such as installing additional software, changing computer settings, and redirecting web browser activity.|
|Potentially unwanted program (PUP)|_PUP_ is software that contains adware, installs toolbars, or has other unclear objectives. A PUP is different from malware because the user gives consent to download it. If you download a program from the internet but forget to read the download agreement, you may end up with unwanted programs being downloaded. A few signs that you have PUPs on your computer include browser popups recommending fake updates or other software; webpages you typically visit not displaying properly; and ads appearing where they shouldn’t.|
|Ransomware|_Ransomware_ denies access to a computer system until the user pays a ransom.|
|Scareware|_Scareware_ is a scam to fool users into thinking they have some form of malware on their system. The intent of the scam is to sell the user fake antivirus software to remove malware they don't have.|
|Crimeware|_Crimeware_ is designed to perpetrate identity theft to allow access to online accounts at financial services, such as banks and online retailers. Crimeware can:<br><br>- Use keystroke loggers to capture keystrokes, mouse operations, or screenshots and transmit those actions back to the attacker to obtain passwords.<br>- Redirect users to fake sites.<br>- Steal cached passwords.<br>- Conduct transactions in the background after logon.|
|Crypto-malware|_Crypto-malware_ is ransomware that encrypts files until a ransom is paid.|
|Remote Access Trojan (RAT)|A RAT is a malware program that includes a back door that allows administrative control over the target computer. RATs are usually downloaded invisibly with a user-requested program, such as a game or an email attachment. A RAT can:<br><br>- Use keystroke loggers that capture keystrokes, mouse operations, or screenshots, and transmits those actions back to the attacker to obtain passwords.<br>- Access confidential information, like credit card and social security numbers.<br>- Format drives.<br>- Activate a system's webcam and record video.<br>- Delete, download, or alter files and file systems.<br>- Distribute viruses and other malware.|

### Historic Malware Events
The amount of computer malware has increased exponentially over time and the nature of malware has grown increasingly malignant and powerful. You should be familiar with the following historic malware events:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Malicious Act|Description|
|Stoned|The 1987 Stoned virus was one of the first viruses. It was very common and widespread in the early 1990s. The virus infects the master boot record of a hard drive and floppy disks.|
|Michelangelo|The 1991 Michelangelo virus was designed to infect MS-DOS systems and remain dormant until March 6, the birthday of Renaissance artist Michelangelo. The virus infects the master boot record of a hard drive. Once a system becomes infected, any floppy disk inserted into the system becomes immediately infected, as well.|
|CIH/Chernobyl Virus|The 1999 Chernobyl virus was the first computer virus that affected computer hardware. It infected executable files, then spread after the file was executed. After it was initiated, CIH would continue until the entire hard drive was erased. Then it would overwrite the system BIOS, causing machines to crash.|
|Melissa|The 1999 Melissa worm was the first widely distributed macro virus that was propagated in the form of an email message containing an infected Word document as an attachment.|
|ILOVEYOU|The 2000 ILOVEYOU worm was propagated in the form of an email message containing an infected VBScript (Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting) attachment. When executed, the VBScript would alter the registry keys to allow the malware to start up at every boot. It would also search for and replace * .jpg, * .jpeg, * .vbs, * .vbe, * .js, * .jse, * .css, * .wsh, * .sct, * .doc, and * .hta files with copies of itself while appending the file name with a .vbs extension.|
|Code Red|The 2001 Code Red worm was designed to attack and exploit vulnerabilities within Microsoft Web IIS servers. It replicated from port to port with remarkable speed, infecting over 250,000 systems in under 9 hours.|
|Nimda|The 2001 Nimda worm took advantage of weaknesses found in the Windows platform and propagated itself in several ways, including email, infected websites, and network shares. It also left multiple back doors to allow for additional attacks.|
|Klez|The 2001-2002 Klez worm propagated through email. It infected executables by creating a hidden copy of the original host file and then overwriting the original file with itself. It attacked unpatched versions of Outlook and Outlook Express to allow attackers to control the system.|

## 2.2.3 - Malware Protection Facts
Malware is software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner’s consent or knowledge. Some malware even takes control of the computer system. Malware often attempts to hide itself.

This lesson covers the following topics:
- Malware prevention
- Additional preventive measures
- Malware recovery

### Malware Prevention
Regardless of the type of malware, there are some common things you can do to prevent malware infection:
- Use the latest version and patch level for your web browser.
- Install the latest patches for the operating system.
- Install antivirus, anti-spyware, anti-rootkit, and personal firewall software.
- Keep definition files up-to-date.
- Use a pop-up blocker to prevent adware.
- Use software to control cookies on the system.
- Perform regular scheduled scans to look for malware.
- Choose anti-malware software from a reputable company. Don't let scareware fool you into purchasing a product that may not work.

### Additional Preventive Measures
In addition, implement the following measures:
- Train users to not download files from unknown sources or open files in suspicious emails. Spyware, adware, crimeware, and Trojans all take advantage of downloads.
- Remove removable drives to prevent unauthorized software from being installed on a system.
- Show full file extensions on all files. Viruses, worms, and Trojans often make use of double file extensions to change files that are normally deemed harmless. For example, adding the extension .TXT.EXE to a file will make the file appear as a text file in an attachment when, in reality, it is an executable.
- Enable antivirus scanning for all email attachments.
- Enable antivirus scanning for all removable storage, such as USB flash drives and CD-ROMs.
- Block executable files that have been copied from another computer. Require that they be manually unblocked before execution.
- Enable privacy controls in Windows Internet Explorer.
    - Delete browsing history.
    - Configure Autocomplete settings to not store entries such as usernames, passwords, web addresses, and forms.
- Use third-party tools to scan for issues and cleanup problems.

### Malware Recovery
Malware can permanently damage your system. Recovery from malware can include the following steps:

- You may have to reinstall applications, features, or even the entire operating system from scratch.
- If your organization uses imaging solutions, you can quickly re-image a machine if it is infected with malware. Re-imaging or installing from scratch is often faster and more effective than malware removal and cleanup.
- _Remediation_ is the process of correcting problems. Most antivirus software remediates problems automatically or semi-automatically by prompting you to identify the action to take. Possible actions in response to problems are:
    - Repair the infection. Repair is possible for true viruses that have attached themselves to valid files. During the repair, the virus is removed and the file is placed back in its original state, if possible.
    - Quarantine the file. Quarantine moves the infected file to a secure folder where it cannot open or run normally. You might quarantine an infected file that cannot be repaired to see if another tool or utility might be able to recover the file at another time.
    - Delete the file. You should delete malicious files such as worms, Trojan horse programs, spyware, or adware programs.
    - Periodically review the quarantine folder and delete any files you do not want to recover.
