## 2.3.2 - Social Engineering Overview Facts
Social engineering refers to an attacker enticing or manipulating people to perform tasks or relay information. Social engineering tries to get a person to do something the person wouldn't do under normal circumstances.

This lesson covers the following topics:
- Manipulation tactics
- Social engineering process

### Manipulation Tactics
Social engineers are master manipulators. The following table describes some of the most popular tactics they use on targets.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Manipulation Type|Description|
|Moral obligation|An attacker uses moral obligation and a sense of responsibility to exploit the target’s willingness to be helpful.|
|Innate human trust|Attackers often exploit a target’s natural tendency to trust others. The attacker wears the right clothes, has the right demeanor, and speaks words and terms the target is familiar with so that the target will comply with requests out of trust.|
|Threatening|An attacker may try to intimidate a target with threats to make the target comply with a request. This is especially the case when when moral obligation and innate human trust tactics are not effective.|
|Offering something for very little to nothing|Offering something for very little to nothing refers to an attacker promising huge rewards if the target is willing to do a very small favor. The small favor can include sharing what the target thinks is a very trivial piece of information for something the attacker offers.|
|Ignorance|Ignorance means the target is not educated in social engineering tactics and prevention, so the target doesn't recognize social engineering when it is happening. The attacker knows this and exploits the ignorance.|

### Social Engineering Process
The social engineering process can be divided into three main phases: research, development, and exploitation. The following table describes each phase.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Phase|Description|
|Research|In the research phase, the attacker gathers information about the target organization. Attackers use a process called _footprinting_, which takes advantage of all resources available to gain information. Footprinting includes going through the target organization’s official websites and social media; performing dumpster diving; searching sources for employees’ names, email addresses, and IDs; going through a tour of the organization; and other kinds of onsite observation.<br><br>Research may provide information for _pretexting_. Pretexting is using a fictitious scenario to persuade someone to perform an unauthorized action such as providing server names and login information. Pretexting usually requires the attacker to perform research to create a believable scenario. The more the attacker knows about the organization and the target, the more believable a scenario the attacker can come up with.|
|Development|The development phase involves two parts: selecting individual targets within the organization being attacked and forming a relationship with the selected targets. Usually, attackers select people who not only will have access to the desired information or object, but who also show signs of being frustrated, overconfident, arrogant, or somehow easy to extract information from. Once a target is selected, the attacker will start forming a relationship with the target through conversations, emails, shared interests, and so on. The relationship helps build the target's trust in the attacker, allowing the targets to be comfortable, relaxed, and more willing to help.|
|Exploitation|In the exploitation phase, the attacker takes advantage of the relationship with the target and uses the target to extract information, obtain access, or accomplish the attacker’s purposes in some way. Some examples include disclosing password and username; introducing the attacker to other personnel, thus providing social credibility for the attacker; inserting a USB flash drive with a malicious payload into a organization's computer; opening an infected email attachment; and exposing trade secrets in a discussion.<br><br>If the exploitation is successful, the only thing left to do is to wrap things up without raising suspicion. Most attackers tie up loose ends, such as erasing digital footprints and ensuring no items or information are left behind for the target to determine that an attack has taken place or identify the attacker. A well-planned and smooth exit strategy is the attacker's goal and final act in the exploitation phase.|

## 2.3.4 -  Social Engineering Motivation Facts
There are many social engineering attacks, types of attackers, and motivation techniques.

This lesson covers the following topics:
- Social engineering attacks
- Types of attackers
- Types of motivation techniques

### Social Engineering Attacks
The following table describes a few social engineering attacks.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Attack|Description|
|Shoulder surfing|Shoulder surfing involves looking over someone's shoulder while that person works on a computer or reviews documents. This attack's purpose is to obtain usernames, passwords, account numbers, or other sensitive information.|
|Eavesdropping|Eavesdropping is an unauthorized person listening to private conversations between employees or other authorized personnel when sensitive topics are being discussed.|
|USB and keyloggers|When on site, a social engineer also has the ability to steal data through a USB flash drive or a keystroke logger. Social engineers often employ keystroke loggers to capture usernames and passwords. As the target logs in, the username and password are saved. Later, the attacker uses the username and password to conduct an exploit.|
|Spam and spim|When using spam, the attacker sends an email or banner ad embedded with a compromised URL that entices a user to click it. Spim is similar, but the malicious link is sent to the target using instant messaging instead of email.|
|Hoax|Email hoaxes are often easy to spot because of the bad spelling and terrible grammar. However, hoax emails use a variety of tactics to convince the target they're real.|

### Types of Attackers
The following table describes different types of attackers.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Type|Description|
|Insider|An insider could be a customer, a janitor, or even a security guard; but most of the time, it's an employee. Employees pose one of the biggest threats to any organization. There are many reasons why an employee might become a threat. The employee could:<br><br>- Be motivated by a personal vendetta because they are disgruntled.<br>- Want to make money.<br>- Be bribed into stealing information.<br><br>Sometimes, an employee can become a threat actor without even realizing it. This is known as an unintentional threat actor. The employee may create security breaches doing what seems to be harmless day-to-day work. An unintentional threat actor is the most common insider threat.|
|Hacker|Generally speaking, a hacker is any threat actor who uses technical knowledge to bypass security, exploit a vulnerability, and gain access to protected information. Types of hackers include:<br><br>- Those motivated by bragging rights, attention, and the thrill.<br>- Hacktivists with a political motive.<br>- Script kiddies, who use applications or scripts written by much more talented individuals.<br>- A white hat hacker, who tries to help a company see the vulnerabilities that exist in its security.<br>- Cybercriminals, who are motivated by significant financial gain. They typically take more risks and use extreme tactics. Corporate spies are a sub-category of cybercriminal.|
|Nation state|Attacks from nation states have several key components that make them especially powerful. Typically, nation state attacks:<br><br>- Are highly targeted.<br>- Identify a target and wage an all-out war.<br>- Are extremely motivated.<br>- Use the most sophisticated attack techniques of all the attackers. This often includes developing completely new applications and viruses in order to carry out an attack.<br>- Are well financed.|

### Types of Motivation Techniques
The following table describes types of techniques a social engineer uses to motivate an employee to provide information.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Technique|Description|
|Authority and fear|Authority techniques rely on power to get a target to comply without questioning the attacker. The attacker pretends to be a superior with enough power that the target will comply right away without question. The attacker could also pretend to be there in the name of or upon the request of a superior. Authority is often combined with fear. If an authority figure threatens a target with being fired or demoted, the target is more likely to comply without a second thought.|
|Social proof|With a social proof technique, the attacker uses social pressure to convince the target that it’s okay to share or do something. In this case, the attacker might say, "If everybody is doing it, then it's okay for you to do it, too."|
|Scarcity|Scarcity appeals to the target's greed. If something is in short supply and will not be available, the target is more likely to fall for it.|
|Likeability|Likeability works well because humans tend to do more to please a person they like as opposed to a person they don’t like.|
|Urgency|To create a sense of urgency, an attacker fabricates a scenario of distress to convince an individual that action is immediately necessary.|
|Common ground and shared interest|Common ground and shared interest work because sharing a hobby, life experience, or problem instantly builds a connection and starts forming trust between two parties.|

## 2.3.6 -  Social Engineering Techniques Facts
Not all attackers are the same. They all have different motives, attributes, and attack characteristics. Attackers also can employ various techniques to obtain what they want from the target.

This lesson covers the following topics:
- Attack types
- Elicitation
- Pretexting, preloading, and impersonation
- Interview and interrogation

### Attack Types
A single hacker trying to exploit a vulnerability will have different attack profile than an organized crime group waging an assault on a network. The following table describes the typical attack type used by each.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Attack|Description|
|Opportunistic|An opportunistic attack is typically automated and involves scanning a wide range of systems for known vulnerabilities. Known vulnerabilities can include old software, exposed ports, poorly secured networks, and default configurations. When a vulnerability is found, the hacker will exploit the vulnerability, steal whatever is easy to obtain, and get out. This type of attack is typically used by a single hacker.|
|Targeted|A targeted attack is much more dangerous. A targeted attack is extremely methodical and is often carried out by multiple entities that have substantial resources. Targeted attacks almost always use unknown exploits, and the attackers go to great lengths to cover their tracks and hide their presence. Targeted attacks often use completely new programs that are specifically designed for the target. This attack type is typically used by an organized crime group.|

### Elicitation
Elicitation is a technique used to extract information from a target without arousing suspicion. The following table describes some elicitation tactics.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Tactic|Description|
|Compliments|An attacker may give a target a compliment about something the target did. The attacker waits for the target to take the bait and elaborate on the subject. Even if the target downplays the skill or ability involved, talking about it might give the attacker valuable information.|
|Misinformation|Using the misinformation tactic, the attacker makes a statement with the wrong details. The attacker’s intent is for the target to provide the accurate details that the attacker wants to confirm. The more precise the details given by the attacker, the better the chance that the target will take the bait.|
|Feigning ignorance|Attackers might make a wrong statement and then admit to not knowing much about the subject. The intent is to get the target to not only correct the attacker, but also explain in detail why the attacker is wrong. The explanation might help the attacker learn, or at least have a chance to ask questions without looking suspicious.|
|Being a good listener|An attacker may approach a target and carefully listen to what the target has to say, validate any feelings the target expresses, and share similar experiences, which may be real or fabricated. The point is to be relatable and sympathetic. As the target feels more connected to the attacker, barriers go down and trust builds. This leads the target to share more information.|

### Pretexting, Preloading, and Impersonation
All social engineering techniques involve some pretexting, preloading, and impersonation. The following table describes these steps.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Step|Description|
|Pretexting|Pretexting is conducting research and information gathering to create convincing identities, stories, and scenarios to be used on selected targets.|
|Preloading|Preloading is used to set up a target by influencing the target’s thoughts, opinions, and emotions.|
|Impersonation|Impersonation is pretending to be trustworthy and having a legitimate reason for approaching the target to ask for sensitive information or access to protected systems.|

### Interview and Interrogation
Another technique social engineers use often is interviews and interrogation. The following table describes some of the most important concepts of conducting a successful interview and interrogation.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Concept|Description|
|Interview vs interrogation|In the interview phase, the attacker lets the target do the talking while the attacker mostly listens. In this way, the attacker has the chance to learn more about the target and how to best extract information. Then the attacker leads the interview phase into an interrogation phase. It’s most effective when done smoothly and naturally, and when the target feels a connection and trusts the attacker. In the interrogation phase, the attacker talks about the target's statements. The attacker is mostly leading the conversation with questions and statements that will flow in the direction the attacker needs to obtain information.|
|Environment|The environment the attacker chooses for conducting an interview and interrogation is essential to setting the mood.<br><br>- The location should not be overly noisy or overly crowded.<br>- The environment should be a relaxing and stress-free setting that puts the target at ease.<br>- The attacker shouldn’t sit between the target and the door. The target should never feel trapped in any way.<br>- Lighting should be good enough for both parties to see each other clearly. This will allow the attacker to better read the target’s micro expressions and movements. It will also inspire trust in the target.|
|Observation|During these interviews and interrogations, the hacker pays attention to every change the target displays. This allows the attacker to discern the target’s thoughts and topics that should be investigated further. Every part of the human body can give a clue about what is going on inside the mind. Most people don’t realize they give many physical cues, nor do they recognize these cues in others. A skilled observer pays close attention and puts these clues together to confirm another person’s thoughts and feelings.|

## 2.3.8 - Phishing and Internet-Based Techniques Facts
Users interfacing with the internet either through email or browsing websites can pose substantial security threats to an organization. Attacks that entice users to provide sensitive information or to click a link that installs malware are called social engineering attacks. Increasing user awareness of the types of threats and how to successfully avoid them is critical to an organization's overall security.

This lesson covers the following topics:
- Phishing
- Other social engineering attacks

### Phishing
Phishing is one of the most successful social engineering attacks. In a phishing attack, the social engineer masquerades as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. The following table describes a few variations of phishing attacks.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Attack|Description|
|Spear phishing|In spear phishing, an attacker gathers information about the victim, such as the online bank. The attacker then sends a phishing email to the victim that appears to be from that bank. Usually, the email contains a link that sends the user to a site that looks legitimate, but is intended to capture the victim's personal information.|
|Whaling|Whaling is another form of phishing. It targets senior executives and high-profile victims.|
|Vishing|Vishing is like phishing, but instead of an email, the attacker uses Voice over IP (VoIP) to gain sensitive information. The term is a combination of voice and phishing.|
|SMS phishing|In SMS phishing (smishing), the attacker sends a text message with a supposedly urgent topic to trick the victim into taking immediate action. The message usually contains a link that either installs malware on the victim's phone or extracts personal information.|

### Other Social Engineering Attacks
The following tables describes other common social engineering attacks.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Attack|Description|
|Pharming|Pharming involves the attacker executing malicious programs on the target’s computer so that any URL traffic redirects to the attacker’s malicious website. This attack is also called phishing without a lure. The attacker is then privy to the user’s sensitive data, like IDs, passwords, and banking details. Pharming attacks frequently come in the form of malware such as Trojan horses, worms, and similar programs. Pharming is commonly implemented using DNS cache poisoning or host file modification.<br><br>- In DNS cache poisoning, the attacker launches the attack on the chosen DNS server. Then, in the DNS table, the attacker changes the IP address of a legitimate website to a fake website. When the user enters a legitimate URL, the DNS redirects the user to the fake website controlled by the attacker.<br>- In host file modification, the attacker sends malicious code as an email attachment. When the user opens the attachment, the malicious code executes and modifies the local hosts file on the user’s computer. When the user enters a legitimate URL in the browser, the compromised hosts file redirects the user to the fraudulent website controlled by the attacker.|
|Social media|Many attackers are turning to applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, to steal identities and information. Also, many attackers use social media to scam users. These scams are designed to entice the user to click a link that brings up a malicious site the attacker controls. Usually, the site requests personal information and sensitive data, such as an email address or credit card number.|
|Typo squatting|Typo squatting, also called URL hijacking, relies on mistakes, such as typos made by users inputting a website address into a web browser. When a user enters an incorrect website address, the squatter may lead them to any URL.  <br>  <br>The typo squatter's URL may be one of several types, but all are similar to the victim site address:<br><br>- Common misspelling of the intended site, such as symantic.com instead of symantec.com.<br>- Misspelling based on a typographical error, such oreintaltrading.com instead of orientaltrading.com.<br>- A plural of a singular domain name, such as viking.com instead of vikings.com.<br>- A different top-level domain, such as tampicoil.org instead of tampicoil.com.<br>- An abuse of the Country Code Top-Level Domain, such as cocoskeelingislands.com instead of cocoskeelingislands.com.au.|
|Hybrid warfare|As it refers to technology, hybrid warfare employs political warfare and blends conventional warfare with cyberwarfare. Its goal is to influence others with things such as fake news, diplomacy, lawfare, and foreign electoral intervention.<br><br>Examples include:<br><br>- Meddling in elections<br>- Misinformation<br>- Meddling in the security of foreign countries<br><br>In 2015, the US Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, developed five pillars to combat hybrid and cyber warfare:<br><br>1. Build and maintain ready forces and capabilities to conduct cyberspace operations.<br>2. Defend the DoD information network, secure DoD data, and mitigate risks to DoD missions.<br>3. Be prepared to defend the U.S. homeland and U.S. vital interests from disruptive or destructive cyber attacks of significant consequence.<br>4. Build and maintain viable cyber options and plan to use those options to control conflict escalation and shape the conflict environment at all stages.<br>5. Build and maintain robust international alliances and partnerships to deter shared threats and increase international security and stability.|
|Watering hole attack|The term "watering hole attack" is derived from predators in the natural world who wait for an opportunity to attack their prey near watering holes. A watering hole is a passive computer attack technique in which an attacker anticipates or observes the websites an organization uses often and infects them with malware. Members of the targeted group can then become infected. Hackers could be looking for specific information to narrow their attacks from users that come from a specific IP address.<br><br>A watering hole attack has five main steps:<br><br>1. The attacker identifies the sites visited by a victim and then infects the sites with malicious code.<br>2. The attacker identifies the vulnerabilities with the sites and injects it with malicious code. This could be JavaScript or code into the ads and banners used on the website.<br>3. The malicious code redirects the victims to a phishing site where there is malware.<br>4. When the victims visit these websites, the script containing malware is automatically downloaded to the victim’s machines without their knowledge.<br>5. The malware then collects personal information from the victims and sends it back to the server operated by the attacker.<br><br>There are several countermeasures against a watering hole attack:<br><br>- Update all your software to the latest versions and keep your operating system up to date.<br>- Configure firewalls, intrusions detection and prevention, and other network security products.<br>- Maintain your company's own website so it is free from malware.<br>- Use a VPN and the private browsing feature web browser’s .<br>- Be aware of the popular websites that employees visit and ensure that those sites are free from malware.<br>- Train users on the dangers of potential watering hole attacks.|
|Credential harvesting|Credential harvesting, also known as password harvesting, is the process of gathering the usernames, passwords, email addresses, and other information through breaches and other activities. Hackers can then sell personal and financial data on the dark web, use the information to gain access to a company network for illegal purposes.<br><br>Hackers might use cloned websites, such as Google, Amazon, eBay, and so on. When a user attempts to log in, they inadvertently send their credentials to the hackers. Hackers will also use phishing emails. Users must stay vigilant when receiving emails and be sure not to click on any unknown or unusual links. This could cause infected programs to download and install that you did not intend.<br><br>To prevent credential harvesting, users must update their security software and be aware of the links they click on and sites they visit.|
