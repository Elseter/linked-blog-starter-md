## 3.1.3 Implement Physical Security
### Prompt
Based on a review of physical security at your office, you have recommended several improvements. Your plan includes installing smart card readers, IP cameras, signs, and an access log book.

In this lab, your task is to:

Implement your physical security plan by dragging the correct items from the shelf onto the various locations in the building. As you drag the items from the shelf, the possible drop locations are highlighted. To implement your plan, you must:

- Install two IP security cameras in the appropriate location to record which employees access the key infrastructure. The security cameras should operate over the TCP/IP network.
- Install the smart card key readers in the appropriate location to control access to key infrastructure. The key card readers should be contactless and record more information than the card's ID.
- Install a Restricted Access sign on the networking closet door to control access to the infrastructure.
- Install the visitor log on the lobby desk.
