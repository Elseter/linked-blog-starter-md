## 5.13.3 Router Security Facts
This lesson covers secure routers.

### Secure Routers
Take the following general actions to secure routers:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Security Measure|Description|
|Change factory defaults|Change default settings on the router to increase security.<br><br>- Change the default manufacturer's username and password and encrypt the new password. Use a complex password instead of passwords that are easy to guess or crack. Complex passwords are typically over eight characters; contain a mix of character types (numbers and symbols); and are not words, variations of words, or derivatives of the username.<br>- Change the default network address. Some routers default to 192.168.1.1 or 10.0.0.1.|
|Use secure protocols|Use encrypted protocols when managing the device. The protocols function as follows:<br><br>- Secure Shell (SSH) allows for secure interactive control of remote systems.<br>    - SSH uses RSA public key cryptography for both connection and authentication.<br>    - SSH is a protocol that can also be used to provide security services for other protocols.<br>- Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) is a secure file copy protocol that uses SSH for security.<br>- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) over SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), known as (HTTPS), is a secure form of HTTP that uses SSL to encrypt data before it is transmitted.<br><br>Do not use HTTP, Telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or Trivial FTP (TFTP). These protocols send data in cleartext. The most secure way to manage a router's configuration is to connect the management station to the router's console port. This creates a dedication transmission path that can't be sniffed by hosts on the network. Also, avoid using UPnP (Universal Plug and Play), unless your routers have the latest firmware updates and your connected devices are free of malware.|
|Implement physical security|Ensure physical security by keeping network devices in a locked room. If someone can gain access to the physical device they can easily bypass any configured passwords. Passwords are useless if physical access is not controlled. Implement the following physical security measures:<br><br>- Perimeter barriers<br>- Closed-circuit television (CCTV)<br>- Doors<br>- Door locks<br>- Physical access logs<br>- Physical access controls|
|Secure configuration file|If possible, store the router configuration file in an encrypted form and back up the file to a secure location.|
|Update firmware|One of the first things you should do when setting up a new router is update the firmware. The updates to the firmware fix any vulnerabilities that have been resolved by the manufacturer in the past.|
|Use anti-spoofing rules|Anti-spoofing rules counter spoofing attacks where IP packets have a source address that does not belong to the sender. Anti-spoofing rules analyze the IP packet and match the router interface and direction from which the packet is received. An inbound packet that comes to the external interface must not have a source address that match the internal network or the router itself.<br><br>A typical anti-spoofing rule will be configured as follows:<br><br>- Source: An IP address belonging to the internal network or the IP address of the router itself<br>- Destination: Any<br>- Service: Any<br>- Interface: Any external interface<br>- Direction: Inbound<br>- Action: Deny<br>- Time: Any|
|Access control lists  <br>(ACLs)|Router access control lists (ACLs) can be configured to increase security and limit traffic much like a firewall, but on the router level. ACLs filter the traffic and determine if the data should be blocked or forwarded.|
