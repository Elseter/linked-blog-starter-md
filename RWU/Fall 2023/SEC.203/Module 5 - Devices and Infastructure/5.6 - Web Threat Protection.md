## 5.6.4 Web Threat Protection Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:
- Web threats
- Web threat protection

### Web Threats
A web threat is any threat that uses the internet to perform some sort of malicious activity. As web attacks become increasingly sophisticated, it is difficult for users to discern legitimate sites, valid links, and safe downloads. Because web threats can wreak so much havoc, organizations are turning to solutions that stop threats before they reach users.

Administrators must choose between using an all-in-one device that provides a one-stop shop for security protection or using dedicated devices for each specific type of threat protection. The choice normally depends on the size of an organization and how much they want to spend.

### Web Threat Protection
The following table describes protections against web threats by using both hardware and software solutions:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Protection|Description|
|Website/URL content filtering|Website and content filtering prevents a user from visiting restricted websites.<br><br>- Specific websites are identified as restricted; employees are not able to view the sites on their browsers.<br>- Website filtering can be used to enforce the organization's internet usage policy.<br>- Website filtering helps to increase bandwidth availability.|
|Web threat filtering|Web threat filtering prevents a user from visiting websites with known malicious content.<br><br>- It maintains a list of websites with known malicious content.<br>- The websites on the list are blocked.<br>- An administrator can monitor sites that have become infected with spyware or other malware. He or she can add those websites to the list.|
|Gateway email spam filters|Gateway email spam filters prevent spam emails from reaching your network, servers, and computers. Spam filters can be configured to block specific senders, emails containing threats (such as false links), and emails containing specific content.|
|Virus scanners|Virus scanners identify infected content and dispose of it. They are often coupled with email scanners.|
|Anti-phishing software|Anti-phishing software scans content to identify and dispose of phishing attempts, preventing outside attempts to access confidential information.|
|Data loss prevention|Data loss prevention are types of software that protects sensitive data from being exposed.|
|Encryption|Encryption causes data, such as the content of an email, to be unintelligible except to those who have the proper key to decrypt it.|
|Proxies|There are several types of proxies that are used to prevent web threats.<br><br>- Transparent proxies are located between a user and the internet, and they can redirect requests without changing the request. These can be used for web filtering.<br>- Forward proxies can be used to filter web content, but can also be used to mask a user's identity for anonymity. This can make it difficult for attackers to target users or an organization.<br>- Reverse proxies can be used for caching and authentication.|
