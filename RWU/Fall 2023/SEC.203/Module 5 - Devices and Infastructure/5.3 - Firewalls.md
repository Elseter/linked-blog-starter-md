## 5.3.2 Firewall Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:
- Firewall functions
- Firewall types
- Firewall security features
- Firewall management practices
### Firewall Functions
A firewall is a device or software running on a device that inspects network traffic and allows or blocks traffic based on a set of rules.
- A network-based firewall inspects traffic as it flows between networks. For example, you can install a network-based firewall on the edge of your private network that connects to the internet to protect against attacks from internet hosts. Network-based firewalls are typically dedicated hardware devices.
- A host-based or application-based firewall inspects traffic received by a host. Use a host-based firewall to protect against attacks when there is no network-based firewall, such as when you connect to the internet from a public location. Host-based firewalls are typically software programs. A host-based firewall can be configured to meet the security requirements of the specific host and add an additional layer of security even when a network firewall has been implemented.
- Firewalls use filtering rules, sometimes called access control lists (ACLs), to identify allowed and blocked traffic. A rule identifies traffic characteristics, such as:
    - The interface to which the rule applies
    - The direction of traffic (inbound or outbound)
    - Packet information, such as the source or destination IP address or port number
    - The action to take when the traffic matches the filter criteria
- Firewalls can protect against external attacks.
- Firewalls don't offer protection against all attacks (for example, spoofed email messages).
- A firewall can impede network availability because it adds processing to network traffic or might drop network traffic when overloaded.

### Firewall Types
The following table explains different firewall types:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Type|Characteristics|
|Packet filtering  <br>(stateless)|A packet filtering firewall makes decisions about which network traffic to allow by examining information in the IP packet header, such as source and destination addresses, ports, and service protocols. A packet filtering firewall:<br><br>- Operates up to OSI Layer 3 (the Network layer)<br>- Uses access control lists (ACLs) or filter rules to control traffic<br>- Offers high performance because it only examines addressing information in the packet header<br>- Can be implemented using features that are included in most routers<br>- Is not very intelligent, so it is subject to DoS and buffer overflow attacks<br>- Is easy to implement and maintain, has a minimal impact on system performance, and is fairly inexpensive<br><br>A packet filtering firewall is considered a stateless firewall because it examines each packet and uses rules to accept or reject each packet without considering whether the packet is part of a valid and active session.|
|Stateful|The stateful inspection firewall (also known as circuit-level proxy or gateway) makes decisions about which traffic to allow based on virtual circuits or sessions. The firewall is considered stateful because it keeps track of the state of a session. A stateful inspection firewall:<br><br>- Operates up to OSI Layer 5 (the Session layer)<br>- Keeps track of known connections and sessions in a session ta_ble_Â (also referred to as a state table)<br>- Allows only valid packets within approved sessions<br>- Verifies that packets are properly sequenced<br>- Ensures that the TCP three-way handshake process occurs only when appropriate<br>- Can filter traffic that uses dynamic ports because the firewall matches the session information (not the port numbers) for filtering<br><br>In general, stateful inspection firewalls are slower than packet filtering firewalls. If only the session state is being used for filtering, a stateful inspection firewall can be faster after the initial session table has been created.|
|Application|An Application layer firewall (also referred to as an Application level gateway or proxy) makes security decisions based on information contained within the data portion of a packet. An Application level gateway:<br><br>- Operates up to OSI Layer 7 (the Application layer)<br>- Stops each packet at the firewall and inspects it, so there is no IP forwarding<br>- Inspects encrypted packets, such as in SSL inspection<br>- Examines the entire content (not just individual packets)<br>- Understands or interfaces with the Application layer protocol<br>- Can filter based on user, group, and data such as URLs within an HTTP request<br>- Is the slowest form of firewall because entire messages are reassembled at the Application layer<br><br>A proxy server is a device that stands as an intermediary between a secure private network and the public and is a specific implementation of an Application level firewall. With a proxy, every packet is stopped and inspected at the firewall, which causes a break between the client and the source server. Proxies can be configured to:<br><br>- Control both inbound and outbound traffic<br>- Increase performance by caching heavily accessed content (content is retrieved from the proxy cache instead of the original server)<br>- Filter content<br>- Shield or hide a private network<br>- Restrict access by user or by specific websites<br>- Allows inspection of encrypted packets, such as SSL inspection|

### Firewall Security Features
Most newer firewalls have flood guard protections built into their feature sets. A flood guard protects against denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The main types of DoS attacks are flood attacks, SYN floods, ping floods, UDP floods, and port floods. The following table explains a few common firewall security features:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Feature|Characteristics|
|Block ping to WAN|This feature helps prevent attackers from discovering your network through ICMP Echo (ping) requests.|
|Stealth Mode|This feature prevents the response to port scans from the WAN. This protects against port floods.|
|TCP Flood|This feature drops all invalid TCP packets. This protects your network from SYN flood attacks.|
|UDP Flood|This feature helps prevent UDP flood attacks by metering the number of simultaneous, active UDP connections from a single computer on the internal network.|
|ICMP Notification|This feature can silently block the sending of ICMP notifications. Some protocols may require these notifications.|
|Fragmented Packets|This feature blocks the sending of fragmented IP packets.|
|SYN Flood Detect Rate|To help prevent SYN floods, this feature monitors the rate of SYN packets during a configuration time period. Too many SYN packets cause the firewall to determine that a SYN flood is occurring and to trigger the appropriate response.|
|Echo Storm Detect Rate|To help prevent ping floods, this feature monitors the rate of echo pings during a configuration time period. Too many pings cause the firewall to determine that a ping flood is occurring and to trigger the appropriate response.|
|ICMP Flood Detect Rate|This feature monitors non-ping ICMP packets. Too many cause the firewall to determine that a ICMP flood is occurring and trigger the appropriate response.|

### Firewall Management Practices
Be aware of the following when managing firewalls:
- When designing firewall packet filters, a common practice is to close all ports. Open only those ports necessary for accessing the resources behind the firewall.
- If a host cannot communicate on the network, or if specific types of traffic (such as ICMP or Remote Desktop connection) don't work on a host, check the host firewall settings to make sure that the traffic type is allowed.
- Firewalls typically create log entries when packets are blocked by firewall rules. You can examine these logs to help troubleshoot communication problems or identify potential attacks (such as DoS attacks).
