## 5.12.2 VLAN Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:

- Virtual LAN (VLAN) overview
- VLAN defaults
- VLAN advantages and disadvantages
- VLANs and Voice over IP

### VLAN Overview
A virtual LAN can be defined as:

- A logical collection of devices that belong together and act as if they are connected to the same wire or physical switch.
- A grouping of devices based on service need, protocol, or other criteria, rather than physical proximity.

VLANs let you assign devices on different switch ports to different logical (virtual) LANs. Although each switch can be connected to multiple VLANs, each switch port can be assigned to only one VLAN at a time. The following graphic shows a single-switch configured with two VLANs:

In this example:

- FastEthernet ports (fa) 0/1 and 0/2 are members of VLAN 1.
- FastEthernet ports (fa) 0/3 and 0/4 are members of VLAN 2.
- Workstations in VLAN 1 are not able to communicate with workstations in VLAN 2, even though they are connected to the same physical switch.
- There are two broadcast domains, each of which corresponds to one of the VLANs. Defining VLANs creates additional and separate broadcast domains.

### VLAN Defaults
Be aware of the following facts about VLANs:

- Many switches have default VLANs. For example most Cisco switches have the following default VLANs:
    - VLAN 1 is the default VLAN. You can use this VLAN but you cannot delete it.
    - VLAN 1002 - VLAN 1005 are reserved for backward compatibility with old VLAN implementations, which are no longer being used. You cannot use or delete these VLANs.
- By default, all ports are members of VLAN 1.
- Depending on the VLAN number, a VLAN is either normal or extended.
    - 1 - 1005 is the normal range for VLANs.
    - 1006 - 4094 is the extended range for VLANs.

### VLAN Advantages and Disadvantages
VLANs with switches offer the following administrative benefits:

- You can create virtual LANs based on criteria other than physical location, such as workgroup, protocol, or service.
- You can simplify device moves. Devices are moved to new VLANs by modifying the port assignment.
- You can control broadcast traffic and create collision domains based on logical criteria.
- You can control security (isolate traffic within a VLAN).
- You can load-balance network traffic (divide traffic logically, rather than physically).

Creating VLANs with switches offers the following benefits over using routers to create distinct networks:

- Switches are easier to administer than routers.
- Switches are less expensive than routers.
- Switches offer higher performance because they introduce less latency.

A disadvantage of using switches to create VLANs is that you might be tied to a specific vendor. How VLANs are created and identified can vary from vendor to vendor. Creating a VLAN using switches might mean you must use only that vendor's switches throughout the network.

If you want to implement VLANs when using multiple vendors in a switched network, be sure each switch supports the 802.1Q standards.

Despite advances in switch technology, routers are still typically used to:

- Filter WAN traffic.
- Route traffic between separate networks.
- Route packets between VLANs, though Layer 3 switches can also do this.

### VLANs and Voice over IP
VLANs are commonly used with Voice over IP (VoIP) to distinguish voice traffic from data traffic. You can give traffic on the voice VLAN higher priority to ensure timely delivery. When using VLANS for VoIP, consider the following facts:

- To create a voice VLAN, use the **switchport voice vlan _[number]_** command.
- By default, IP phone traffic on a voice VLAN is tagged with an 802.1Q priority of 5.
- When an interface is configured with a voice VLAN, the PortFast feature is automatically enabled on the interface.
- A Cisco IP phone automatically uses the VLAN ID of the port it is connected to. Non-Cisco IP phones require the VLAN ID to be manually configured on the IP phone.
