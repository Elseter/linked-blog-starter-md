### Security Switch Features
The following table lists switch features that can be implemented to increase network security:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Feature|Description|
|Virtual LAN  <br>(VLAN)|A virtual LAN (VLAN) is a logical grouping of computers based on switch ports.<br><br>- VLAN membership is configured by assigning a switch port to a VLAN.<br>- A switch can have multiple VLANs configured on it, but each switch port can only be a member of a single VLAN (see exception described below).<br>- VLANs can be defined on a single switch or configured on multiple interconnected switches. With multiple switches, each switch can be configured with the same VLANs, and devices on one switch can communicate with devices on other switches as long as they are members of the same VLAN.<br>- A trunk port is used to connect two switches together.<br>    - Typically, Gigabit Ethernet ports are used for trunk ports, although any port can be a trunk port.<br>    - A trunk port is a member of all VLANs defined on a switch and carries traffic between the switches.<br>    - When trunking is used, frames that are sent over a trunk port are tagged by the first switch with the VLAN ID so that the receiving switch knows to which VLAN the frame belongs.<br>    - The Trunking Protocol describes the format that switches use for frame tagging with the VLAN ID.<br>    - Because end devices do not understand the VLAN tags, the tag is removed from the frame by the switch before the frame is forwarded to the destination device.<br>    - VLAN tagging is only used for frames that travel between switches on the trunk ports.<br>- Using VLANs, the switch can be used to create multiple IP broadcast domains. Each VLAN is in its own broadcast domain, and broadcast traffic is sent only to members of the same VLAN.<br>- In a typical configuration with multiple VLANs, workstations in one VLAN can not communicate with workstations in other VLANs. To enable inter-VLAN communication, you need to use a router (or an OSI Layer 3 switch).|
|MAC filtering/port security|With switch port security, the devices that can connect to a switch through the port are restricted.<br><br>- Port security uses the MAC address to identify allowed and denied devices.<br>- On the switch, MAC addresses are stored in RAM in a table and are associated with the port. The table can be manually configured, or learning devices can automatically build the table.<br>- You can specify that only a single MAC address is allowed per port, or you can configure the each port to allow multiple addresses.<br>- With automatic configuration, the next device or specified number of devices can connect to the port and additional devices are denied.<br>- A port violation occurs when an unauthorized device tries to connect. The switch configuration determines how the switch handles frames from an unauthorized device. The switch can either drop all frames from the unauthorized device or shut down the port, disabling all communications through that port.|
|Port authentication (802.1x)|Port authentication is provided by the 802.1x protocol and allows only authenticated devices to connect to the LAN through the switch. Authentication uses user names and passwords, smart cards, or other authentication methods.<br><br>- When a device first connects, the port is set to an unauthorized state. Ports in unauthorized states can be used only for 802.1x authentication traffic.<br>- The process begins by the switch sending an authentication request to the device.<br>- The device responds with authentication credentials, which are forwarded by the switch to the authentication device (such as a RADIUS server).<br>- After the server authenticates the device or the user, the switch port is placed in an authorized state, and access to other LAN devices is allowed. When a device disconnects, the switch places the port in the unauthorized state.|

### Implement Switch Security
Be aware of the following when implementing switch security:

- Creating VLANs with switches offers many administrative benefits. For example, you can:
    - Create virtual LANs based on criteria such as workgroup, protocol, or service
    - Simplify device moves (devices are moved to new VLANs by modifying the port assignment)
    - Control broadcast traffic based on logical criteria (only devices in the same VLAN receive broadcast traffic)
    - Control security (isolate traffic within a VLAN)
- When you use switches to create VLANs, you still need routers to:
    - Route data between VLANs
    - Provide port filtering. Port filtering filters network packets in and out of devices based on their application type or port number.
    - Route data into and out of the local area network
- VLANs are commonly used with voice over IP (IP (VoIP) to distinguish voice traffic from data traffic. Traffic on the voice VLAN can be given a higher priority to ensure timely delivery.
- MAC filtering uses the MAC address of a device to drop or forward frames through the switch. Port authentication requires that the user or device authenticates before frames are forwarded through the switch.
- In general, all switch ports are enabled by default. To increase the security of the switch and network, you should disable individual ports that are not in use.

### Spanning Tree Protocol
To provide fault tolerance, many networks implement redundant paths between devices using multiple switches. However, providing redundant paths between segments causes packets to be passed between the redundant paths endlessly. This condition is known as a switching loop. Switching loops lead to incorrect entries in a MAC address table, making a device appear to be connected to the wrong port and causing unicast traffic to be circulated in a loop between switches. The Spanning Tree Protocol runs on switches to prevent switching loops by making only a single path between switches active at a single time.

The Spanning Tree Protocol also:
- Provides redundant paths between devices
- Recovers automatically from a topology change or device failure by unblocking redundant paths
- Identifies the optimal path between any two network devices
- Calculates the best loop-free path through a network by assigning a role to each bridge or switch and by assigning roles to the ports of each bridge or switch

The type of ports used by the Spanning Tree Protocol are:
- Root ports, which are configured to communicate directly to the root switch.
- Designated ports, which forward frames to and from attached hosts.
- Blocked ports, which form a loop and are used for redundancy.

Ports in the Spanning Tree Protocol exist in one of five states:
- Blocking
- Listening
- Learning
- Forwarding
- Disabled

## 5.11.7 - Switch Attack Facts
This lesson covers common switch attacks.

### Common Switch Attacks
The following table describes common attacks that are perpetrated against switches.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Attack|Description|
|MAC flooding|_MAC flooding_ overloads the switch's MAC forwarding table to make the switch function like a hub. MAC flooding is performed using the following method:<br><br>1. The attacker floods the switch with packets, each containing a different source MAC address.<br>2. The flood of packets fills up the forwarding table and consumes so much of the memory in the switch that it causes the switch to enter a state called _fail open mode_. In fail open mode, all incoming packets are broadcast out to all ports (as with a hub), instead of to the designated port (as a switch normally does).<br>3. The attacker then captures all the traffic with a protocol analyzer/sniffer.|
|ARP spoofing/poisoning|_ARP spoofing/poisoning_ associates the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of victim's device.<br><br>- When computers send an ARP request for the MAC address of a known IP address, the attacker's system responds with its MAC address.<br>- The source device sends frames to the attacker's MAC address instead of the correct device.<br>- Switches are indirectly involved in the attack because they do not verify the MAC address/IP address association.<br>- A default gateway is a prime target because local traffic goes through a default gateway to get to non-local destinations such as the internet.<br>- When the attacker's system MAC address receives packets intended for the default gateway, the attacker can:<br><br>- Forward the packets to the actual default gateway ( _passive sniffing_).<br>- Modify data in the packets before forwarding it ( _man-in-the-middle)_.|
|MAC spoofing|_MAC spoofing_ is changing the source MAC address on frames. The attacker's system sends frames with the spoofed MAC address. The switch reads the source address contained in the frames and associates the MAC address with the port where the attacker is connected. MAC spoofing can be used to:<br><br>- Bypass 802.1x port-based security.<br>- Bypass wireless MAC filtering.<br>- Hide the identity of the attacker's computer or to impersonate another device on the network.<br>- Impersonate a device on the network to capture frames addressed to that device.<br>- Impersonate a valid device on the network to gain network access. For example, to gain access when the switch is using the MAC address to allow or deny a network connection.|
|Dynamic Trunking Protocol  <br>(DTP)|Switches have the ability to automatically detect trunk ports and negotiate the trunking protocol used between devices. The Dynamic Trunking Protocol is not secure and allows unauthorized devices to possibly modify configuration information. You should disable the DTP services on the switch's end user (access) ports before implementing the switch configuration into the network.|
