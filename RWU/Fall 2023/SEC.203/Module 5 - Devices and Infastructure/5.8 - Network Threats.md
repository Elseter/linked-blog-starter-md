## 5.8.2 - Network Threats Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:
- Network segmentation
- Network attack types
- User education and training
- Threat focus points

### Network Segmentation
The main component of secure network-architecture concepts is network segmentation. The idea behind proper network segmentation is that if a system or systems were compromised, the damage would be limited to that network segment. Network segmentation also makes it much easier to identify suspicious network traffic since the network traffic is broken into manageable chunks.

For example, if your network has static systems, such as IoT devices, you probably want to have them on their own network segment. This minimizes the damage they can cause to a single network segment and makes identifying issues with them much easier. Likewise, you would probably need to segment the wireless network from the wired network since wireless networks are inherently less secure. Segmenting workstations from authentication servers, SQL servers, or DNS servers is also essential.

The most common way to segment networks is to create multiple virtual local area networks (VLANs) for each network zone. These zones can also be separated by firewalls to ensure only specific traffic is allowed. When creating these zones, it is helpful to create different categories or purposes for each zone; for example, a no-trust zone, low-trust zone, medium-trust zone, high-trust zone, and highest-trust zone.

The no-trust zone is the zone that you have no control over. It is where everything but your network residesâ€”in other words, the internet. The low-trust zone is where publicly available information resides. You do have control over the security of this zone, but it is still exposed to the internet. For example, a web server might reside in this zone. This kind of zone is also referred to as a DMZ, or demilitarized zone.

### Network Attack Types
Network attacks are classified as follows:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Technique|Description|
|Active|Active attacks are when perpetrators attempt to compromise or affect the operations of a system in some way. For example, trying to brute-force the root password on a web server is considered an active attack. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is also an active attack.|
|Passive|Passive attacks occur when perpetrators attempt to gather information without affecting the flow of that information from the targeted network. For example, sniffing network packets or performing a port scan are both types of passive attacks. The goal isn't to immediately compromise a system, but to learn about that system.|
|External|External attacks are when unauthorized individuals try to breach a network from off-site. It is key to remember that with external attacks, the perpetrator is unauthorized for any level of access to the network.|
|Inside|Inside attacks are initiated by authorized individuals inside the network's security perimeter who attempt to access systems or resources to which they're not authorized. For example, an inside attack is a disgruntled employee accessing unauthorized company documents and leaking them to the public.|

### User Education and Training
User education and training is a very important aspect of maintaining a secure network environment. Attackers often send phishing emails to organizations in an attempt to compromise an employee workstation. The workstation is used as a pivot point to gain access to more sensitive systems. Another attack strategy is to compromise an employee's personal device that connects to the company's Wi-Fi. The personal device is then used as a pivot point. Because of this threat, it's imperative to educate users to be security-aware.

### Threat Focus Points
As a security professional, you need to understand your network on multiple levels. You should focus on the following:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Areas of Focus|Description|
|Entry points|Recognize all vulnerabilities and entry points for possible attacks. This includes public-facing servers, workstations, Wi-Fi networks, and personal devices. You must account for anything that connects to the network as a possible entry point.|
|Inherent vulnerabilities|Identify inherent vulnerabilities or systems that lack proper security controls. For example, if your organization needs to use an older version of Windows for a particular application, you need to identify that system as a vulnerability. Internet of Things (IoT) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) devices are both systems that lack proper security controls and therefore must be dealt with appropriately.|
|Documentation|Document all network assets in your organization and create a suitable network diagram that you can use as a reference. This is probably one of the most important components of knowing your system. If you don't know the underlying infrastructure of your network, then you can't adequately secure it. Proper network documentation and diagrams not only help you identify a weak network architecture or design, but protect against system sprawl and unknown systems.|
|Network baseline|Identify a network baseline. This means that you need to know your systems' normal activity, such as regular traffic patterns, data usage, network activity, server load, and anything system-related. Mainly, you need to know what your network looks like in normal day-to-day usage. Knowing this allows you to identify unusual or atypical activity that can indicate an attack in progress or a compromised network. To identify a network baseline, you can use network tools that monitor network traffic and create a graphical representation of the collected data.|
