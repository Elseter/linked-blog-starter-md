## 5.1.3 - Security Zone Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:
- Security zones
- Security zone networks
- Common security zones

### Security Zones
Security zones are portions of the network or system that have specific security concerns or requirements. All devices with the same zone have the same security access and security protection needs. These zones are often separated by a traffic control device, such as a firewall or a router, that filters incoming and outbound traffic. For example, you can define a zone that includes all hosts on your private network protected from the internet. You can also define a zone within your network for controlled access to specific servers that hold sensitive information.

### Security Zone Networks
The following table lists types of networks found in your security zones:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Network Type|Description|
|Wireless|A wirelessly broadcasted network is used on most internal networks so that internal users do not require a physical connection to a router or switch.|
|Guest|A guest network at an organization often grants internet access only for guest users, but it also has some type of firewall to regulate that access. There could be limited internal resources made available on a guest network. Normally, it is just a way for guests to access the internet without being allowed on the intranet or internal network.|
|Honeynet|A honeynet is a special network created to trap potential attackers. Honeynets have vulnerabilities that lure attacks so that you can track their actions and protect your real network. Honeynets can generate extremely useful security information.|
|Ad hoc|An ad hoc network is a decentralized network that allows connections without a traditional base station or router. It allows users to connect two or more devices directly to each other for a specific purpose.|

### Common Security Zones
The following table lists common zones:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Zone|Description|
|Intranet|An intranet is a private network (LAN) that employs internet information services for internal use only. For example, your company network might include web servers and email servers that are used by company employees.|
|Internet|The internet is a public network that includes all publicly available web servers, FTP servers, and other services. The internet is public because access is largely open to everyone.|
|Extranet|An extranet is a privately controlled network distinct from the intranet but located between the internet and a private LAN. An extranet is often used to grant resource access to business partners, suppliers, and even customers outside of the organization.|
|Wireless|A wireless zone is a broadcasted network connection used within an organization. Users don’t need a physical connection to a network port to connect to the intranet or internal resources. Instead they use a wireless connection on their device to connect to a wireless access point.|
|Demilitarized zone|A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a network that contains publicly accessible resources. The DMZ is located between the private network and an untrusted network (such as the internet) and is protected by a firewall.  <br><br>A bastion host is a server that is exposed to attacks by untrusted networks. It can be placed inside the DMZ or exposed on the public network.|

## 5.1.5 - Security Solution Facts
This lesson covers network security solutions.

### Network Security Solutions
The following table lists additional network security solutions that can be configured to increase network security:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Device|Description|
|Proxy server|A proxy server is a type of firewall that stands as an intermediary between clients requesting resources from other servers. A proxy server is often called an application-level gateway because it performs filtering at the Application layer. Proxies can be configured to:<br><br>- Restrict users on the inside of a network from getting out to the internet.<br>- Restrict access by user or by specific website.<br>- Restrict users from using certain protocols.<br>- Use access controls to control inbound or outbound traffic.<br>- Shield or hide a private network to provide online anonymity and make it more difficult to track web surfing behavior.<br>- Cache heavily accessed web content to improve performance.<br><br>Proxy servers can also be a security risk and can be used to circumvent network security and even attack a network.|
|Internet content filter|An internet content filter is software used to monitor and restrict content delivered across the web to an end user. Companies, schools, libraries, and families commonly use content filters to restrict internet access, block specific websites, or block specific content.<br><br>- Two types of configurations are commonly used, which are:<br>    - Allow all content except for the content you have identified as restricted.<br>    - Block all content except for the content you have identified as permitted.<br>- Allowed or blocked content is identified by the following:<br>    - Whitelists identify allowed sites or content.<br>    - Blacklists identify disallowed or blocked content.<br>    - Category levels use classification to block content based on content type.<br>- Common methods for restricting content include:<br>    - Categorization of the content (such as sport sites, gambling sites, etc.)<br>    - URLs<br>    - DNS<br>- Parental controls is content filtering software used by parents at home to monitor and restrict child web access.<br>- Content filtering software can be expanded to include email, instant messaging, and other applications in addition to web content.<br>- Most internet content filters can also block pop-ups and filter spam.<br>- Keyword filtering can be configured to block the results of searches on specific words.|
|Network Access Control  <br>(NAC)|Network Access Control (NAC) controls access to the network by not allowing computers to access network resources unless they meet certain predefined security requirements.<br><br>- NAC attempts to unify endpoint security by defining the security measures that must be in place for a computer requesting access to the network.<br>- NAC requires a NAC agent (software to monitor the health of a machine) to be installed on each computer as part of the security requirements for computers attempting to gain access.<br>- A client determined healthy by the NAC agent is given access to the network.<br>- An unhealthy client (one that has not met all the checklist requirements) is either denied access or can be given restricted access to a remediation network. After this, remediation servers can help the client become compliant.<br>- NAC is often used with 802.1x as an authentication protocol for port-based security. In addition to meeting authentication requirements, the client must also meet health requirements before access is granted through 802.1x.<br>- Microsoft's version of the NAC security tool is Network Access Protection (NAP).|
|All-in-one security appliances|All-in-one security appliances combine many security functions into a single device. All-in-one security appliances are also known as unified threat security devices or web security gateways_._ This type of device may be the best choice for:<br><br>- A small company without the budget to buy individual components.<br>- A small office without the physical space for individual components.<br>- A remote office without a technician to manage the individual security components.<br><br>Security functions in an all-in-one security appliance can include:<br><br>- Spam filters<br>- URL filters<br>- Web content filters<br>- Malware inspection<br>- Intrusion detection systems<br><br>In addition to security functions, all-in-one security appliances can include:<br><br>- Network switches<br>- Routers<br>- Firewalls<br>- Tx uplink (integrated CSU/DSU)<br>- Bandwidth shaping|
|Application-aware devices|An application-aware device has the ability to analyze and manage network traffic based on the Application layer protocol that created it. Some of these devices can also apply quality of service (QoS) and traffic-shaping rules based on the application that created network traffic. Consider the following examples:<br><br>- An application-aware firewall can enforce security rules based on the application that is generating network traffic instead of the traditional port and protocol.<br>- An application-aware IDS or IPS can analyze network packets to detect malicious payloads targeted at Application layer services (such as a web server).<br>- An application-aware proxy manages traffic based on the Application layer protocols they support, such as FTP or HTTP. This allows the proxy to perform two key functions:<br>    - Prevent the application client from performing undesirable actions. For example, an FTP proxy could be configured to allow FTP clients to perform downloads but inhibit uploads.<br>    - Improve application performance. For example, an HTTP proxy can be configured to cache frequently accessed web pages.|
