## 2.4.6 - Server Core Management Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:
- Initial configurations
- PowerShell cmdlets

### Initial Configurations
As with a desktop experience Windows server system, you need to perform several initial configuration tasks immediately after installing a Server Core system as follows:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Task|Process|
|Name the computer|The process for naming the computer is as follows:  <br><br>1. Use the **hostname** command to display the generated server name.<br>2. Use the **netdom renamecomputer** command to rename the computer.<br>3. Reboot the computer using the **shutdown /r** command.<br>4. Verify the name has been changed by entering **hostname** and verifying the name change.|
|Set the time and time zone|As a security measure against replay attacks, the time must synchronize on servers in the domain.  <br><br>1. Use **control timedate.cpl** to display the Date and Time dialog.<br>2. Adjust the date, time, and time zone.|
|Assign a static IP address to the server|To assign a static IP address, use **netsh** commands to:  <br><br>1. Determine the adapter's index number.<br>2. Set the IP address, subnet mask, and the default gateway.<br>3. Add a DNS server that has addresses for the domain.|
|Join the server to the domain|Joining a server to the domain as follows:  <br><br>1. Use a **netdom** command to join the server to the domain.<br>2. Reboot the computer to become a member of the domain.|

### PowerShell Cmdlets
You can use the following PowerShell cmdlets to manage Server Core:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Task|Commandlets (cmdlets)|
|General|**PowerShell** starts a PowerShell session on Server Core.  <br>**Get-Help** displays the help screen for the specified PowerShell cmdlet. Use this cmdlet to view the specific syntax necessary to use cmdlets.|
|System information and configuration|**Get-DisplayResolution** displays the current screen resolution.  <br>**Get-Service** displays a list of each service installed on the system and each service's status.  <br>**Rename-Computer** sets the computer name.  <br>**Restart**-**Computer** reboots the system.  <br>**Set**-**DisplayResolution** sets the screen resolution.  <br>**Sconfig** displays the Server Configuration utility – an interface used to change to the server settings.  <br>**Set**-**TimeZone** assigns the desired time zone.  <br>**Stop**-**Service** stops a running service.  <br>**Start**-**Service** starts a service.|
|Network and domain configuration|**Add**-**Computer** provides a prompt to enter credentials needed to join a domain.  <br>**Get**-**DNSClientServerAddress** displays the current DNS server address configured on the network interface.  <br>**Get**-**NetIPInterface** displays the network interfaces installed in the system.  <br>**Get**-**NetIPConfiguration** displays the current network configuration.  <br>**Netdom remove** removes a computer from a domain.  <br>**New**-**NetIPAddress** assigns a new IP address to a network interface.  <br>**Set**-**Date** assigns the system date and time.  <br>**Set**-**DNSClientServerAddress** assigns a DNS server address to a network interface.|
|Local user and group management|**Net localgroup Administrators /add** adds a user to the local admin group.  <br>**Net localgroup Administrators /delete** removes a user from the local admin group.  <br>**Net localgroup** **/add** adds a local group.  <br>**Net user** \***/add** adds a local user.  <br>**Net user administrator *** sets a new local admin password.|
|Active Directory (AD) User and Group Management|**New-ADGroup** creates an AD group.  <br>**Set-ADGroup** modifies an active AD group.  <br>**Remove-ADGroup** removes an AD group.  <br>**New-ADUser** creates an AD user.  <br>**Set-ADUser** modifies an active AD group.  <br>**Remove-ADUser** removes an AD user.  <br>**Set-ADAccountPassword** sets a password for an AD user account.|
