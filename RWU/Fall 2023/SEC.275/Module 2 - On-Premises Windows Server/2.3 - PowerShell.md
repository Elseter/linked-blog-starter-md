This lesson covers the following topics:
- PowerShell
- Terminology
- Modules
- Help

### PowerShell
PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool that you can use to automate system administration and application management tasks from the command line. Using PowerShell, you can manage the Windows operating system and applications that run on Windows by entering commands from the command line. By writing PowerShell scripts, you can perform management tasks involving many operations much faster than if you were using the graphical user interface (GUI).

Some server management tasks can only be completed using PowerShell.

### Terminology
The following terms are used with PowerShell:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Term|Definition|
|Command Line|The _command line_ refers to the command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with a computer. Commands are entered at the command prompt. The command line interface:<br><br>- Is text-based.<br>- Uses a simple command construction or syntax.<br>- Uses flags, or switches, to specify an option in the command.|
|Cmdlets|_Cmdlets_ are commands that an administrator enters at the PowerShell prompt to perform system management tasks. The PowerShell command-line interface uses simple command construction, typically in the form of: [verb]-[noun]-[adverb]. For example:<br><br>- **New-** or **Add-** or **Install-** will create a new entity.<br>- **Get-** is used to retrieve information about an existing entity.<br>- **Set-** is used to make a change to an existing entity.<br><br>  <br>When using PowerShell cmdlets, keep in mind the following:<br><br>- The cmdlets are usually not case-sensitive.  <br>    <br>- When using PowerShell to turn on features, use the same case indicated in the cmdlet help.  <br>    <br>- PowerShell cmdlets are designed to be lightweight, easy to recognize, and easy to use.  <br>    <br>- Use the TAB key to cycle through the available options. Type a PowerShell verb followed by a hyphen (for example, New-) and press the TAB key again and again to cycle through the options. This feature is called tab completion.  <br>    <br>- Installing new services and features on a Windows server may also install additional PowerShell modules that contain cmdlets required to manage the newly added services and features.  <br>    <br><br>If you write a script that requires the cmdlets from a module that hasn't been added to PowerShell, you can add the cmdlets by manually importing the module. To do this, use the following cmdlet: **Import-Module <module_name>**|
|Providers|Windows PowerShell providers are .NET programs that allow you to access data stores, such as the registry and certificate store, in a way similar to accessing a data path on the file system.|

### Help
PowerShell provides help files. These help files include cmdlets, scripts, workflows, functions, and more. PowerShell help can be accessed using the following cmdlets:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Cmdlet|Description|
|Save-Help|Use to download help files from the internet onto a local file share.|
|Update-Help|Use to download updates to help files from the internet onto a local file share.|
|Get-Help|Use to access help files downloaded onto the local file share. These help topics include cmdlets, scripts, workflows, functions, and more.  <br>  <br>If help files have not been downloaded, this command displays auto-generated help topics and gives you the option to download help files or access them online.|
