## 2.6.6 - Performance Monitor Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:
- Baseline
- Task Manager
- Performance Monitor
- Reliability Monitor

### Baseline
A _baseline_ is a measurement of how a system should be running. This can be accomplished by taking snapshots after installation, when systems are functioning as intended. Performance should be analyzed at regular intervals and compared to this baseline. Numbers that are far below or far above your baseline could indicate a problem.

### Task Manager
_Task Manager_ is a Windows utility that displays information about the system's resource use. The utilization statistics provided in Task Manager can help resolve system problems. For example:

- When experiencing poor performance, look for a process that is using more CPU resources than it should.
- Memory utilization can be useful when identifying a memory leak. When an application does not release memory that is no longer needed, more and more memory resources could be consumed until all available memory is used by that application.  

The tabs displayed in Task Manager are described in the following table:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Tab|Description|
|Processes|Displays currently running applications and background processes. Select the arrow to the left of a listed background process to expand the process tree and view a list of applications and/or services that are dependent on the process.  <br>  <br>Statistics for CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk I/O, and network utilization are listed to the right of each application and process.  <br>  <br>Stop an unresponsive application or process from this tab. Select the application or process, and then select **End Task**.|
|Performance|Provides an overall view of how well the system is performing. This tab graphs CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization. Select the small graph on the left to display a larger graph for that resource. Keep the following in mind regarding the Performance tab:<br><br>- If the computer has more than one physical CPU or the CPUs have more than one core, you can display a graph of each CPU by right-clicking the CPU graph and selecting **Change graph to \ Logical processors**.<br>- If the CPU Usage History graph shows a percentage above 80%, this can signify that a program may be unresponsive or over-utilizing CPU resources. Momentary spikes, however, do not indicate a problem.  <br>    <br>- If the Memory graph is consistently high, this could be caused by a memory leak or too many applications simultaneously open without enough memory installed in the system. Use information on the Details tab to identify the application or applications using large amounts of memory.  <br>    <br><br>The Performance tab displays snapshots of CPU usage. To drill down and gather more detailed and granular CPU performance data, use Performance Monitor.|
|Users|Displays each user currently logged in to the computer. You can disconnect a user on this tab if necessary.|
|Details|Displays information for each process running on the system:<br><br>- Process name<br>- The process ID (PID)<br>- Status<br>- User who started the process<br>- CPU utilization<br>- Memory utilization<br>- A process description<br><br>  <br>Use the Details tab to:<br><br>- Kill, or end, a process or process tree (all processes and associated sub-processes).<br>- Set the processor affinity. The affinity identifies which processors or processor cores the process can use. For example, a process can be configured to run on only one of the cores in a quad-core CPU. You cannot change the affinity of some Windows processes.<br>  <br>- Configure the process priority. The priority controls how the system can delay or switch between processes. Priority settings are:  <br>    <br><br>- Realtime<br>- High<br>- Above normal<br>- Normal<br>- Below normal<br>- Low<br><br>Setting a process to Realtime will dramatically decrease the performance of other processes on the system. Try using High or Above normal for a process to assign more CPU time.<br><br>- By default, the system typically gives a higher priority to a process that has active user input or interaction.<br>- Processes can continue to run in the background when the user is not actively interacting with the application. Virus scanners, video compression, and backups are examples of processes that run in the background while the user works in a different application.|
|Services|Shows a list of services that have run since the computer started. Use the Services tab to:<br><br>- Start or stop a service<br>- View the process associated with the service|

### Performance Monitor
_Performance Monitor_ can examine your server's performance in real time and by collecting log data for later analysis. The following table lists several tools associated with Performance Monitor:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Tool|Description|
|Monitoring tools|Performance Monitor displays real-time visual graphs of a computer's overall performance.  <br><br>- Track performance by using objects and counters:<br>    - An object is a statistic group that often corresponds to a specific type of hardware device or software process.<br>    - A counter is a specific statistic you can monitor. For example, for the PhysicalDisk object, you can monitor counters such as %Disk Read Time or %Idle Time.<br>- Add or remove counters to customize the statistics displayed.<br>- Display data in the following forms:<br>    - Line graph<br>    - Histogram<br>    - Report (text)<br><br>By itself, Performance Monitor does not save any data. To save statistics over time, use a data collector set (DCS).<br><br>Run **perfmon.exe** to load Performance Monitor from the command prompt. The following options are available with this command:<br><br>- Run **perfmon /sys** to open Performance Monitor in stand-alone mode. This compares multiple logs by overlaying each log onto a base log. Compare statistics between logs using the **Compare** option.<br>- Run **perfmon /report** to quickly generate and display a system diagnostic report.|
|Data Collector Set (DCS)|A Data Collector Set (DCS) captures system performance statistics over a period of time. A DCS includes one or more data collectors that identify the specific objects and counters you want to track.  <br>When creating a counter, specify the local computer or a remote computer to be monitored. Monitoring a remote computer provides a more accurate view of performance since it doesn't include the load of running Performance Monitor.  <br>Define custom collector sets by using templates or creating sets manually. Windows comes with the following default collector sets:<br><br>- The system performance set collects information about the CPU, hard disk drive, system kernel, and network performance. By default, it collects information for ten minutes. Use this set for a computer that is running slow or having intermittent performance problems.<br>- The system diagnostics set collects detailed system information in addition to the data gathered in the system performance set. By default, it collects information for 1 minute. Use this set to troubleshoot reliability problems related to defective hardware or driver failures.<br><br>Since the system performance collector set has fewer counters, use it instead of the system diagnostics collector set whenever possible.<br><br>There are four types of data collectors:<br><br>- Performance counters save system statistics to a performance log. Performance logs can be read by Performance Monitor and the Reports tool. Logs can be saved to different log formats:<br>    - Use text files (comma or tab delimited) to import data into a spreadsheet program.<br>    - Use binary files to save data that is intermittent. Select a circular file to save all data into a single file, overwriting the contents when the log is full.<br>    - Use SQL database files to import statistics into an SQL server to perform data comparisons or data archival.<br>- Event trace captures events logged by software processes.<br>- Configurations monitor the state of registry keys and changes to them.<br>- Performance counter alerts configure alert triggers. When configuring an alert, specify:<br>    <br>    - The counter to watch.<br>    - A threshold limit (a counter value that will trigger an alert when exceeded).<br>    - An action to take when the threshold value is reached.<br>    <br>      <br>    <br><br>When configuring data collector sets:<br><br>- The schedule specifies how often to start a collection task. For example, you can configure the collector to start every day at a specific hour.<br>- To collect data for a specified amount of time, configure the overall duration on the **Stop Condition** tab of the collector set. Once the collectors in the set start, they will automatically stop when the duration period is reached.<br>- To control how frequently a counter is sampled, configure the sample interval on the **Performance Counters** tab of the data collector. For example, you can configure the collector to get information every 15 minutes.<br>- Control how frequently new log files are created using the limit duration setting for the stop condition. For example, configuring a limit duration of five minutes would create a new log file every five minutes.<br>- Use the **When a limit is reached, restart the data collector set** option to break the log file into multiple files. When the duration or maximum size is reached, a new log file is created.|
|Reports|Use the Reports tool to view the collected data or to create new reports from data collector set counters. Keep the following in mind about Performance Monitor reports:<br><br>- If a collector set has not been defined and run, no reports will be available.<br>- Membership in the local Performance Log Users group, Administrators group, or equivalent is required to view the reports.<br><br>  <br>The Reports tool displays a System Diagnostic report, or system health report, that includes the status of hardware resources, system response times, and processes on the local computer. The report includes suggestions of ways to maximize performance and streamline system operation. Membership in the local Administrators group or equivalent is required to generate a system diagnostic report. To generate a report:<br><br>1. Start the System Diagnostic data collector set in Performance Monitor.<br>2. In the advanced tools of the Performance Information and Tools console, select **Generate a system health report.**|
|logman.exe|Use this command with the following options to create and manage logs:<br><br>- **create counter** creates a new performance counter data collector.<br>- **create trace** creates a new event trace data collector.<br>- **create config** creates a new configuration data collector.<br>- **start** starts an existing collection and sets the begin time to manual.<br>- **stop** stops an existing collection and sets the end time to manual.|
