## 2.1.2 - Windows Server Facts
This lesson covers Windows Network Models.

### Windows Network Models
A Windows system can fulfill different roles on a network depending upon how the system and network are deployed. The following table describes three standard network models that are common with Windows systems:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Model|Description|
|Stand-alone|In the stand-alone model:<br><br>- Each host functions independently.<br>- Communication takes place using a commonly available public network, such as the internet.<br>- The hosts are not connected by a local area network.|
|Workgroup|The workgroup model is based on peer-to-peer networking. In the workgroup model:<br><br>- None of the hosts in a workgroup have a specific role.<br>    - All hosts can function as both workstation and server.<br>    - All hosts in a workgroup can both provide network services and consume network services.<br>- The hosts are linked together by some type of local network connection.<br>- Hosts in the same workgroup can access shared resources on other hosts.<br><br>  <br>Drawbacks of the workgroup model are:<br><br>- Lack of scalability.<br>- Lack of centralized configuration control.<br>- Lack of centralized authentication.<br>- Lack of centrally applied security settings.<br>- Complex data backup process.|
|Client-server|In the client-server model, each host has a specific role in the network:<br><br>- Servers provide file storage, authentication, email, and printing. A server may even be configured as a hypervisor, which allows the server to run multiple virtual machines. Virtual machines can be used as single-purpose servers, such as hosting enterprise applications that might be incompatible with other enterprise applications.<br>- Clients request services from servers.<br><br>  <br>The client-server model is known as **domain networking** in a Windows environment. Key domain networking facts include the following:<br><br>- Domain networking uses security principles, which are entities such as users and computers.<br>- A Windows domain is a collection of security principles that share a central authentication database called Active Directory.<br>- The Active Directory database is located on one or more servers in the domain.<br>- Domains are much more efficient and scalable than workgroups due to a centralized management structure and function.<br><br>  <br>Drawbacks of the client-server model include the following:<br><br>- Increased implementation cost due to specialized hardware and software requirements.<br>- Increased planning time required for implementation.<br>- Increased implementation complexity.<br>- Increased knowledge required to manage the implementation.|

## 2.1.6 -  Server Installation Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:

- Windows Server editions
- System requirements
- Installation options
- Licensing

### Windows Server Editions
Windows Server 2022 has two main editions – Standard and Datacenter. Both editions have several shared functions, including:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Function|Description|
|Active Directory Domain Services|Active Directory Domain Services can organize users, computers, and other resources into logical groups.|
|Windows Defender|Windows Defender is built-in security software. It provides antivirus and firewall protection.|
|Hyper-V|The Hyper-V role in Windows Server enables you to create and manage virtual machines.|
|Internet Information Services|Internet Information Services (IIS) is a Windows web server. An IIS server receives and responds to client requests for HTML pages and files.|
|Windows Deployment Services|Admin can use Windows Deployment Services to deploy the Windows operating system to computers across the network.|
|DHCP services|A DHCP server assigns an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway to each client.|
|DNS server|A DNS server translates a domain name into its associated IP address.|
|File and Storage Services|File and Storage Services can be used to manage file servers – a centralized location for storing files that are shared with all users across a network.|
|Network load balancing|Network load balancing distributes traffic across servers, ensuring a steady flow of information across a network.|
|Windows Server Update Services|Windows Server Update Services allows administrators an easy way to find and deploy Microsoft product updates.|

Additional features of each edition include:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Edition|Features|
|Windows Server 2022 Standard|- Access Licenses (CALs)<br>- Supports up to 48 TB of RAM<br>- Supports up to 64 64-bit sockets<br>- Supports an unlimited number of cores<br>- Storage Replica (One resource group and one partnership with a 2 TB volume)|
|Windows Server 2022 Essentials|- Supports up to 25 users<br>- Supports up to 50 devices|
|Windows Server 2022 Datacenter|- Supports unlimited VMs<br>- Shielded Hyper-V VMs for increased security and isolation<br>- Supports up to 48 TB of RAM<br>- Supports up to 64 64-bit sockets<br>- Supports an unlimited number of cores<br>- Software-defined networking<br>- Unlimited Storage Replica<br>- Storage Spaces Direct<br>- Network Controller|
|Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition|- Azure Extended Network<br>- Hotpatching<br>- Storage Spaces Direct|

### System Requirements
The minimum hardware requirements for a Windows Server installation are as follows:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Requirement Type|Description|
|Processor|Processor requirements include:<br><br>- 1.4 GHz 64-bit processor<br>- x64 instruction set compatibility<br>- Must support:<br>    - NX and DEP<br>    - CMPXCHG16b, LAHF/SAHF, and PrefetchW<br>    - Second level address translation (EPT or NPT)|
|Network adapter|Network adapter requirements include:  <br><br>- Ethernet adapter with at least 1 gigabit per second throughput<br>- PCI Express compliant<br>- Support for Pre-boot Execution Environment (PXE) is recommended but not required<br>- Support for KDNet network debugging is recommended but not required|
|Storage|Note the following storage requirements:  <br><br>- A Windows Server storage adapter needs to be PCI Express compliant<br>- Hard disk drives cannot be PATA<br>- Boot, page, and data drives cannot be ATA, PATA, EIDE, or IDE<br>- The system partition must be at least 32 GB (This is the bare minimum needed to run the core operating system. Additional space will be required to implement a server effectively.)|
|RAM|RAM requirements include:  <br><br>- 512 MB (Server with Desktop Experience installation option requires 2 GB)<br>- Error Correcting Code (ECC) type or similar technology for physical host deployments|
|Additional requirements|Additional requirements include:  <br><br>- Trusted Platform Module<br>- Graphics device and monitor that supports 1024x768 or higher resolution<br>- UEFI 2.3.1 c-based system and firmware that supports secure boot|

### Installation Options
There are two installation options available:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Option|Description|
|Server Core|Server Core:<br><br>- Includes basic server components<br>- Supports all server roles<br>- Does not include a graphical user interface (GUI)<br>- Can be managed remotely using PowerShell or Windows Admin Center<br>- Is the recommended installation type for most organizations|
|Server with Desktop Experience|Server with Desktop Experience:<br><br>- Includes all server components<br>- Supports all server roles<br>- Includes a GUI<br>- Takes up more installation space than Server Core|

### Licensing
Windows Server licensing is dependent on:

- The number of core processors
- The number of users connecting to the server. Client Access Licenses (CALs) can be purchased for:
    - A specific number of CALs per server
    - A CAL for every client that accesses the server
- Administrators can use a Key Management Services (KMS) host to activate client licenses across a network. A host can be a client or a server machine. Generic Volume License Keys (GVLK) activate the client operating system, and the licensing is assigned to the server.
