## 2.2.4 - Server Roles and Features Facts

This lesson covers the following topics:
- Server roles  
- Role services  
- Features  
- Roles and feature management

Functionality and services are added to a server using the Add Roles and Features wizard. The software is categorized as follows:
- A _server role_ describes the primary function of a server. A server role is a set of applications or services that enable a server to perform a specific function on the network.
- _Role services_ are the applications combined to provide the functions of a role. Role services are sub-components of a role. Some roles, like DNS Server, have a single role service. Other roles, like Print and Document Services, have multiple role services.  
    
- A _feature_ is a software program that is not directly related to a server role but adds functionality to the entire server. Features include management tools, communication protocols or clients, and clustering support.  
### Server Roles and Role Services
Available server roles and role services include:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Server Role|Description|
|Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)|AD DS is a distributed database that stores and manages network resources, such as users and computers. The AD DS role:<br><br>- Helps administrators securely manage information.<br>- Facilitates resource sharing and collaboration between users.<br>- Is required for directory-enabled applications, such as Microsoft Exchange Server, and for applying technologies, such as Group Policy.|
|Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)|AD CS is an identity and access control feature that creates and manages public key certificates used in software security systems. The AD CS role:<br><br>- Provides customizable services for creating and managing public key certificates.<br>- Enhances security by binding the identity, device, or service to a corresponding private key.<br>- Includes features that allow you to manage certificate enrollment and revocation in various scalable environments.<br><br>  <br>Role services include:<br><br>- Certificate Authority<br>- Certificate Enrollment Policy Web Service<br>- Certificate Enrollment Web Service<br>- Certificate Enrollment Authority Web Enrollment<br>- Network Device Enrollment Service<br>- Online Responder|
|Active Directory Federation Services|Active Directory Federation Services enables an organization to share identity information outside its network. This service allows users access to a partner organization using their login.|
|Active Directory Rights Management Services|Active Directory Rights Management specifies permissions for accessing folders and files. Role services include:<br><br>- Active Directory Rights Management Server<br>- Identify Federation Support|
|DNS server|The DNS service maps IP addresses to logical hostnames. DNS servers provide name resolution services, providing IP addresses for known hostnames, or hostnames for known IP addresses. The Windows DNS service provides support for IPv6 addresses.|
|DHCP server|The DHCP service provides network hosts IP addresses and other IP configuration information. Host computers contact the DHCP server at startup to obtain an IP address, default gateway address, DNS server address, and other configuration information. The Windows DHCP service supports IPv6 addressing and configuration information.|
|File and Storage Services|File and Storage Services include technologies that help you set up and manage file servers. This role is valuable when users need access to the same files and applications, or if centralized backup and file management are essential to the organization. New features/functionality include:<br><br>- Storage spaces and storage pools, which enable you to virtualize storage.<br>- Unified remote management of File and Storage Services in Server Manager enables you to manage multiple file servers remotely.<br>- Windows PowerShell cmdlets for File and Storage Services allow you to perform most administration tasks for file and storage servers.<br><br>  <br>Role services include:<br><br>- File and iSCSI services<br>- File server<br>- DFS replication<br>- Server for NFS<br>- Storage services<br><br>The File and Storage Services role installs by default.|
|Host Guardian Service|The Host Guardian Service provides attestation and Key Protection Services that shield virtual machines from malicious software or a potentially compromised host.|
|Hyper-V|The Windows Hyper-V hypervisor provides the layer of software necessary for installing virtual guest operating systems within virtual machines.|
|Print and Document Services|The Print and Document Services role provides the print management console to manage printers on multiple servers. Role services include:<br><br>- Printer server<br>- LPD service|
|Remote Access|Administrators use Remote Access to configure and manage systems across the network from a centralized location. Role services include:<br><br>- DirectAccess and VPN (RAS)<br>- Routing<br>- Web Application Proxy|
|Remote Desktop Services|Remote Desktop Services allows clients access to server-hosted desktops and applications, reducing the need to install software on individual workstations. Role services include:<br><br>- Remote Desktop Virtualization Host<br>- Remote Desktop Connection Broker<br>- Remote Desktop Gateway<br>- Remote Desktop Licensing<br>- Remote Desktop Web Access|
|Volume Activation Services|Volume Activation Services can be used to automate the delivery and management of Microsoft software volume licenses.|
|Web Server (IIS)|Web Server (IIS) is the web server service. Use IIS to host internal and external web sites or services that communicate using HTTP and support ASP.NET applications accessed through a web browser. Many other roles also use IIS to provide web-based administration or access. Role services include:<br><br>- Web server<br>- Directory browsing<br>- HTTP errors<br>- Static content<br>- HTTP redirection<br>- HTTP logging<br>- Tracing<br>- Performance<br>- URL authorization<br>- IP and domain restrictions<br>- ASP<br>- FTP server<br>- Management service|
|Windows Deployment Services (WDS)|WDS is a disk imaging solution that you can use for remote deployment and automated installation of Microsoft Windows operating systems.|
|Windows Server Update Server (WSUS)|The WSUS server allows administrators to manage and distribute updates through a management console. A WSUS server can also update other WSUS servers within the organization. Role services include:<br><br>- WSUS services<br>- SQL server connectivity<br>- WID connectivity|

### Features
Server features include:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Features|Description|
|Failover clustering|Provides high availability and scalability to your network by grouping servers into clusters.|
|Group Policy Management|Allows you to specify configurations for users and computers through Group Policy settings.|
|Network Load Balancing (NLB)|By managing two or more servers as a single virtual cluster, NLB enhances the availability and scalability of internet server applications such as those used on web, FTP, firewall, proxy, virtual private network (VPN), and other mission-critical servers.|
|BitLocker Drive Encryption|A security feature that protects a server by encrypting the operating system volume and verifying the integrity of other startup components. BitLocker is also called full volume encryption.|
|Windows Server Backup|Provides backup and recovery for Windows Server systems.|

### Roles and Feature Management
Roles, role services, and features can be added using:

- The Roles and Features wizard.
- The Install-WindowsFeature PowerShell cmdlet.
- A PowerShell script to install roles and features on several servers at once.

Roles, role services, and features can be removed using:

- The Remove Roles and Features wizard.
- The Uninstall-WindowsFeature PowerShell cmdlet.

To optimize your system resources, only install the roles, services, and features you need. You must be logged in as administrator to install or uninstall roles, role services, or features.
