## 3.2.2  - Architectural Components of Azure Facts
Azure is a cloud-based set of services. Azure provides scalability and security, making it an ideal solution for any sized business, whether a company is just emerging or well-established across the globe.

This lesson covers the following topics:
- Regions and zones
- Services
- Resources and subscriptions

### Regions and Zones
Azure has numerous data centers scattered across the world. These data centers house the physical hardware used to host your organization’s services and resources.

The following table identifies the methods used to organize these data centers. Sometimes, you may need to use one of Azure’s special regions. These are designed specifically to address governmental legal and compliance concerns. These regions may be specific to your state or country.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Method|Description|
|Regions|These data centers are organized into geographical areas called _regions_. Each region comprises one or more data centers. Although users may be using resources from multiple locations, they will not notice the regions. However, as an administrator, you may need to select the region where your resources should be deployed. The benefits of these regions include:<br><br>- Resources can be closer to the user<br>- Load balancing<br>- Scalability<br>- Redundancy<br>- Resiliency<br><br>  <br>Sometimes, you may need to use one of Azure’s special regions. These are designed specifically to address governmental legal and compliance concerns. These regions may be specific to your state or country.|
|Availability zones|_Availability zones_ include one or more data centers within the same region in different geographical locations. The centers are connected using private fiber-optic networks. Each center can operate on its own if needed so that if one location stops working, the other will continue operations. Not all services can be associated with an availability zone.  <br><br>Availability zones are not offered in all regions. Azure does maintain a list of regions that currently support availability zones.|
|Region pairs|_Region pairs_ are established to provide even further redundancy. If a natural disaster or other event were to impact two or more data centers in the same region, all services would fail over to the region’s pair.|

### Services
Azure services are divided into general categories. The following chart provides the categories along with several associated services.

|   |   |
|---|---|

|Resource groups|_Resource groups_ are logical containers for resources. Policies, permissions, and other operations can be applied to the resource group as a whole. Additionally, resource groups can protect resources from being inadvertently deleted.|
|Subscriptions|_Subscriptions_ combine user accounts with the resources that user has created. Each subscription has associated quotas. These quotas limit the total resources a user can use or create.|
|Management groups|_Management groups_ contain one or more resources to be managed and could include:  <br><br>- Virtual machines<br>- SQL databases<br>- Storage<br>- Web apps<br><br>  <br>Conditions apply to the management group. All subscriptions inherit these conditions within the group.|

Azure services are managed through the _Azure portal_ which consists of a dashboard with a graphical user interface. The dashboard can be customized for organization and ease of accessibility.

The _Azure Resource Manager (ARM)_ is a management service that provides a location to manage all resources in your Azure account. Using Azure Resource Manager, you can:

- Create resources
- Update resources
- Delete resources
- Secure resources

The _Azure Marketplace_ holds an array of 3rd party resources available for purchase. Each resource is designed and certified to run on Azure.

## 3.2.10 -  Azure Security and Features Facts
Azure helps to provide security for processes runing in your data center and the cloud.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Defense in depth
- Security tools and features
- Network security features

### Defense in Depth
Security threats exist at all levels of an organization. You must consider implementing defense mechanisms at all access levels to protect your organization best.

Microsoft realizes that cloud security is the responsibility of both the customer and the cloud provider. They have approached security measures based on confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA principles). They build their defenses based on the idea that each layer adds more security and helps ensure that even if one layer is lost, others will continue to defend.

The following table describes each of the defense levels.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Layers|Description|
|Data|The data layer includes data stored in databases, virtual machines, cloud storage, and SaaS applications. Many regulatory requirements are in place to ensure that data remains confidential.|
|Application|The application layer includes applications and application secret storage. Ideally, an organization should integrate security into its application development process.|
|Compute|The compute layer includes virtual machines, systems, and endpoints. Each of these should be secured and should have access controls in place.|
|Network|Network includes all network resources. Network segments, secure connectivity, limited internet access, and secure connectivity between cloud and on-premises networks help with this defense.|
|Perimeter|Firewalls and DDoS protection are the primary defenses at the perimeter level. It’s harder to eliminate a threat once it has breached your perimeter.|
|Identity and access|Identify and access defense measures include SSO and multifactor authentication, control access, and event audits, ensuring that access is only granted as needed and logging all events and changes.|
|Physical|The physical layer includes building security and data center access. Physical defenses help to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to a building or a data center and that any loss or theft is documented and addressed.|

### Security Tools and Features
