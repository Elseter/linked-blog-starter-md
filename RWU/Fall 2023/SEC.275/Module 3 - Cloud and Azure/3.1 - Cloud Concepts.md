## 3.1.3  - Cloud Concept Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:
- Cloud service types
- Cloud service models
- Cloud service benefits

Cloud computing combines software, data access, computation, and storage services provided to clients through the internet. It describes the internet infrastructure in computer network diagrams. Typical cloud computing providers deliver common business applications accessed from a web service or software such as a web browser.

### Cloud Service Types
A cloud connection can exist over the internet or a LAN. Cloud computing does not always require end-user knowledge of the physical location or configuration of the system that delivers the services. It depends on the type of cloud computing used.

Cloud computing may be implemented in several ways, including the following:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Type|Description|
|Public cloud|Anyone can access a public cloud. Cloud-based computing resources such as platforms, applications, and storage are made available to the public by a cloud service provider. The service provider may require a fee for using these resources.|
|Private cloud|A private cloud provides resources to a single organization. Access is granted only to users within the organization. Private clouds are typically hosted internally, but an organization may use third-party hosting because of the necessary expense and expertise.|
|Hybrid cloud|A hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private clouds that are leveraged for certain kinds of apps.|

### Cloud Service Models
Cloud computing service models include the following:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Model|Description|
|Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)|Delivers infrastructure to the client, such as processing, storage, networks, and virtualized environments. The customer rents the infrastructure components that they need.  <br>  <br>With IaaS, the provider is responsible for managing the following aspects of the infrastructure:<br><br>- Computing power<br>- Storage<br>- Networking<br><br>  <br>The customer is responsible for managing:<br><br>- Operating systems<br>- Applications<br>- Data<br>- Access<br><br>  <br>Azure virtual machines and Azure Storage are examples of IaaS.|
|Platform as a Service (PaaS)|The deployment comes without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. PaaS is often used for development, analytics, and business intelligence.  <br>  <br>With Paas, the provider is responsible for managing the following aspects of the platform:<br><br>- Operating systems<br>- Computing power<br>- Storage<br>- Networking<br><br>  <br>The customer is responsible for managing:<br><br>- Data<br>- Access<br>- Applications<br><br>  <br>Azure App Services and Azure SQL Database are examples of PaaS.|
|Software as a Service (SaaS)|SaaS delivers software applications to the client over the internet or on a local area network. It is by far the most used model.  <br>  <br>With software as a service, the provider is responsible for managing the following aspects of the software applications:<br><br>- Operating system<br>- Networking<br>- Storage<br>- Computing power<br>- Applications<br><br>  <br>Microsoft Outlook, Calendar, Teams, OneDrive, and Office 365 are examples of SaaS.|

### Cloud Service Benefits
This section discusses the benefits and drawbacks of cloud services. Some of the benefits of cloud services include the following:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Benefit|Description|
|Backup|The cloud provides reliable backup solutions. That means you won't lose data when a local storage device fails.|
|Accessibility|The cloud gives you access to your data on any device and from any location. All you need is the right application and an internet connection.|
|Collaboration|Cloud-based applications give you the ability to share documents and collaborate with other people to create and edit documents.|
|Resource pooling|Many businesses want to expand their computing resources without purchasing and maintaining additional in-house hardware or hiring and training new staff. For these companies, low-cost cloud hosting solutions are a great option.|
|Elasticity|Most cloud services are pay-as-you-go, meaning that an organization only pays for what they use.|

Some of the drawbacks of cloud services include the following:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Drawback|Description|
|Privacy and security concerns|Data files stored on the cloud are susceptible to hackers, who gain access to cloud storage devices or capture data as it travels over the internet between the local device and the cloud. Most cloud service providers use encryption for this reason.|
|Internet connection issues|While storing data on the cloud is beneficial when you need access from multiple devices, it's a problem when the internet connection goes down. Without a local copy of files, your productivity may be dependent on the quality of your internet connection.|
|Cloud hosting outages|Even if the internet is up and running, you may be unable to access the files when the cloud service is down. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and other cloud hosting businesses work hard to avoid downtime, but there will always be short periods of hardware or software failure. For this reason, you should keep an offline copy of any critically important files or applications.|
