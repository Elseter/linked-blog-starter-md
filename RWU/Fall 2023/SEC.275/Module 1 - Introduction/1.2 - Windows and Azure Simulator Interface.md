## 1.2.3 -  Navigate the Windows Client Interface Facts

Microsoft has kept certain aspects of the Windows interface the same throughout its various iterations, but has updated other features at times as well. Being familiar with the components of the Windows interface makes navigating much easier and efficient.

This lesson covers the following topics:
- Windows interface components
- New Windows 11 features

### Windows Interface Components
The following table describes some of the common components of the Windows interface:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Component|Purpose|
|Desktop|The desktop is the working surface that contains icons used to access programs, files, applications, and file systems. The desktop is what's seen when all programs and open folders are minimized. Installing an application often adds an icon to the desktop.|
|Start menu|The Start menu is the easiest way to access the most useful things on a computer.  <br><br>- At the top is a search field that can be used to search for a known application.<br>- Below the search field are apps pinned for quick access.<br>    - You can customize the order of pinned apps.<br>    - Pinned apps can be added and removed from the Start menu.<br>- In the top-right corner, you can select **All apps** to list all the applications on the computer in alphabetical order.<br>- Right-clicking an app will give you the option to pin or unpin it to the Start menu.<br>- Apps can also be uninstalled from the Start menu.<br>- Accessing account settings, switching users, or locking the desktop can all be done from the Start menu's Profile section.<br>- Power options and advanced features are available in the bottom-right corner. Right-click the Start button to access the advanced features for OS management.|
|Taskbar|The taskbar is the bar at the bottom of a Windows desktop.

## 1.2.6 - Navigate the Windows Server Interface Facts
Windows Server 2022 has many of the same interface features as Windows 11, but there are some key differences.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Windows Server 2022 interfaces
- Windows Server 2022 interface features

### Windows Server 2022 Interfaces
Windows Server can be installed with a desktop experience, which provides a graphical user interface (GUI). Windows Server can also be installed without a GUI, in which case PowerShell is used to manage and configure the server environment. The following table describes both of these options:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Tool|Description|
|Server Manager|After installing Windows Server, Server Manager can be used to configure the server using the following steps:<br><br>1. Configure this local server<br>2. Add roles and features<br>3. Create a server group (optional)<br><br>Options available from the Manage menu are:<br><br>- Add roles and features<br>- Remove roles and features<br>- Add servers<br>- Create server group<br>- Server Manager properties<br><br>You can access Server Manager tools through the **Tools** menu. Tools are automatically added to the Tools menu when additional server roles and services are installed.<br><br>Roles and server groups display the status of each server and role. You can configure the status refresh time in **Manage** > **Server Manager Properties**. A server, server group, or role displayed in red indicates a problem. The following information displays for the local server, all servers, and installed roles:<br><br>- Manageability<br>- Events<br>- Services (if applicable)<br>- Performance<br>- BPA results|
|PowerShell|Windows PowerShell is a command line shell scripting language that can be used to administer, maintain, and configure the server. Designed for system administration, Windows PowerShell uses _cmdlets_ to control and automate the administration of the Windows operating system and applications that run on Windows. Windows PowerShell:  <br><br>- Is built on the .NET Framework<br>- Automates administrative tasks<br>- Uses PowerShell commands called cmdlets that:<br>    - Allow the system to be managed from a command line<br>    - Use a verb and a noun separated by a hyphen (for example, **Get-Help**, **Get-Process**, and **Start-Service)**<br>    - Can execute single commands or large scripts<br>    - Allow actions of two or more cmdlets to be strung together and have the output from one cmdlet automatically sent to the input of the next. This is known as _pipelining_ or _piping_.<br><br>PowerShell provides help for each cmdlet using the **Get-Help** cmdlet. You can use the **Update-Help** cmdlet to download and install the newest versions of help topics for modules installed on your computer.|
