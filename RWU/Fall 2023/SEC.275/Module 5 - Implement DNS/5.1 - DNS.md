## 5.1.2  - DNS Facts
On all networks, including the internet, computers use IP addresses to identify each other and specify where data should go. It is much easier for users to use hostnames instead of IP addresses. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates hostnames to IP addresses. This is what makes using the internet so easy.

This lesson covers the following topics:
- DNS structure
- DNS process
- DNS records

### DNS Structure
DNS is a hierarchical naming system. Hierarchical means that the system is organized with a root level at the top and everything branches out from that.

A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a domain name that spells out each level of the hierarchy. For example, www.testout.com. is a FQDN. The following table describes each section of the FQDN.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|FQDN Section|Description|
|Root Level|The highest level in the DNS hierarchy. The DNS root level is represented by a period at the end of the of the FQDN.  <br>  <br>When typing the FQDN into a web browser, you typically don't include the period. The period is mainly used when defining DNS records on the server.|
|Top-level domain (TLD)|The next highest level in the DNS hierarchy. TLDs have extensions such as com, edu, gov, org, etc.|
|Domain name|The name unique to each organization. The DNS domain is referred to as distributed because this portion is unique to each organization or group.  <br>  <br>Each organization is responsible for maintaining its own namespace.|
|Hostname|This is the name of specific hosts on the network.<br><br>- On an internal network, an example of a hostname is server1 or server2.<br>- On the internet, this is typically www.<br>- On a webserver, www may be the name of the root folder that all website files are stored in.|

DNS zones are used to maintain and define the domain namespace (e.g., testout in www.testout.com). Subdomains, such as labs.testout, are also defined and managed in DNS zones. You can manage multiple subdomains on one server or define them in their own DNS zone as needed.

A DNS zone is defined using a DNS zone file. The DNS zone file is a text document stored on each server. It defines the DNS zone and how it should function. Be aware that:

- Each DNS zone must have its own zone file.
- When defining a DNS zone, a forward lookup zone or a reverse lookup zone must be specified. You must define zones; limitations in DNS do not allow this to happen automatically.
    - A forward lookup zone matches the hostname to the IP address.
    - A reverse lookup zone matches the IP address to the hostname.

DNS zones can take a lot of work to setup and configure properly. A good practice is to have multiple backups of the DNS zones located on different servers.

- You can also use the backups to make the DNS process more efficient. The drawback is if any DNS information needs to be updated, those changes must be made manually on each server. If the information on any of the secondary DNS servers is incorrect, the DNS process will fail.
- To mitigate this, you can implement DNS zone transfers. With a DNS zone transfer, you make the changes only on the primary DNS zone file. The changes are automatically sent out to backup DNS servers.

You can also configure DNS servers with IP mappings for internal network hosts and infrastructure devices such as routers and switches. Since most network hosts are typically assigned IP addresses through DHCP, those IP mappings must be updated constantly. Be aware that:

- Manually maintaining DNS records for DHCP clients requires an inordinate amount of administrative overhead.
- To make things easier, most DHCP and DNS servers support a feature called Dynamic DNS (DDNS).
- Using DDNS, the DHCP server sends an update to the DNS server whenever it assigns an address to a DHCP client.
- The DNS server automatically creates the appropriate mapping.
- When the DHCP lease is released or expires, the mapping is automatically removed from the DNS server.

### DNS Process
When a web browser sends a DNS request to discover the IP address of the requested site, the name resolution process involves multiple servers. The following table describes each of these servers:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|DNS Server|Description|
|Root server|Root DNS servers hold information for the root zone ( . ). Root servers answer name resolution requests by supplying the address of the corresponding top-level DNS server.  <br>  <br>While there are only 13 root servers, there are multiple copies of these servers spread out across the globe. These copies map to the same IP addresses to handle all DNSrequests.|
|Top-level domain (TLD) server|The TLD servers contain the information for all websites that share a common domain extension, such as .com or .org.|
|Authoritative name server|The server that contains the DNS information for a site or domain such as testout.com. The server is authoritative because it doesn't have to ask another DNS server for help; it holds the information already.  <br>  <br>There are usually two authoritative DNS servers per domain.|
|Recursive server|The recursive server handles the DNS name resolution process.|
|HOSTS file|The HOSTS file is a local text file on each computer that maps hostnames to IP addresses. The HOSTS file was used previously for smaller networks but is too complicated to use on networks or the internet.  <br>  <br>Although the HOSTS file is rarely used today, it is still the first place that a computer looks during the name resolution process.|

When the hostname of a computer is used to request a website or network device, recursion is used to find the IP address. A _recursive lookup_ is the process of a DNS server asking other DNS servers to perform name resolution.

During the recursive lookup, the following steps occur:

1. The host looks in its local cache to see if it has recently resolved the host name. If the information is not in the cache, it checks the Hosts file.
2. If the IP address is not found, the host contacts its preferred recursive DNS server. If the preferred DNS server can't be contacted, the host continues contacting additional DNS servers until one responds.
3. The host sends the name information to the recursive DNS server. The recursive DNS server checks its cache and Hosts file. If the information is not found, the DNS server checks any zone files that it holds for the requested name.
4. If the recursive DNS server is unable to find the name in its zones, it forwards the request to one of the root servers which looks at the address and responds with the appropriate top-level domain server's IP address.
5. The recursive server then asks the top-level domain server for the information and the TLD server answers with the IP address of the domain's name server.
6. The recursive server sends the request to the domain's name servers which now respond with the requested IP address.
7. The recursive server sends the domain's IP address the host.
8. The host then sends the request to the domain's server and retrieves the requested content.

To help speed up the process, a DNS server can store known IP mappings in it's cache. This is the first place that is checked during the recursive lookup. Because IP mappings can change frequently, the DNS time-to-live (TTL) should be configured.

When the TTL expires, the recursive server clears its cache. The next time the site is requested, the recursive process repeats.

### DNS Records
There are many types of DNS records that can be configured. The following table describes the most commonly used DNS records:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|DNS Record|Description|
|A (host address)|Maps an IPv4 (32-bit) DNS host name to an IP address. This is the most common resource record type.|
|AAAA (quad-A)|Maps an IPv6 (128-bit) DNS host name to an IP address.|
|Pointer (PTR)|Maps an IP address to a host name (by pointing to an A record).|
|Canonical name (CNAME)|Provides alternate names (or aliases) to hosts that already have a host record. For example:  <br><br>> sales.testout can be mapped to the IP address of testout.com<br><br>If a single A record is used with multiple CNAME records, only the A record needs to be modified when the IP address changes.|
|Mail exchange (MX)|Identifies servers used for handling email.|
|TXT|Stores plaintext notes in a DNS zone. This record type can be used to help verify domain ownership and prevent email spam.|
|Start of authority (SOA)|Stores all the administration information about the DNS zone. For example, the administrator's email address, TTL values, primary name server, and more information is recorded in this file.  <br>  <br>SOA records are very important in the zone transfer process.|
|Name server (NS)|Defines the authoritative server for a specific domain. This record identifies all name servers that can perform name resolution for the zone.  <br>  <br>Typically, there is an entry for the primary server and all secondary servers for the zone (all authoritative DNS servers).|
|DNS service (SRV)|Defines a host and port for a specific service, such as voice over IP. This allows clients to find services through DNS. Windows automatically creates these records as needed.|
