## 5.2.4 Name Resolution Facts
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed database that maps logical names to IP addresses. DNS allows users to reference computers using logical host names. The host names are translated to IP addresses using DNS. A DNS server performs this service on a TCP/IP network.

This lesson covers the following topics:
- DNS domains
- DNS terms
- DNS resolution process

### DNS Domains

A DNS server holds a database of hostnames and their corresponding IP addresses. Clients query the DNS server to get the IP address of a given host. The DNS hierarchy is made up of the following components:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Domains|Definition|
|Fully qualified domain name  <br>(FDQN)|Includes the hostname and the names of all domains between the host and the root.|
|Root|This is the highest domain in the DNS hierarchy and is separated from the Top Level Domain by a dot.  <br>Example: **testout.com**|
|Top-level domain  <br>(TLD)|Highest level of the domain names. The names are delegated to specific organizations such as .com, .edu, and .gov.|
|Second-level domain  <br>(SLD)|Second-level domains are located directly below the top-level domain and are generally referred to as the organization that registered that domain name.|
|Hostname  <br>(domain name)|The first part of the FDQN. WWW, for example, is the most common web server domain name.|

### DNS Terms
Become familiar with the following:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Term|Definition|
|Forward lookup|A forward lookup uses the hostname or FDQN to find the IP address.|
|Reverse lookup|A reverse lookup uses the IP address to find the hostname or FDQN.|
|Authoritative server|An authoritative server is a DNS server with a complete copy of all records for a particular zone.|
|Referral|Referral is the process by which the DNS servers use one another to resolve requests from the specific clients. Because each DNS server is responsible for a small piece of the DNS namespace, the servers contact one another when they cannot resolve queries from their own clients. For example, a root DNS server refers to the DNS servers to .com, .edu, or .gov DNS servers.|
|Recursion|Recursion is the process in which a DNS server or host root name server and subsequent servers perform name resolution. Most client computers do not perform recursion. Instead, they submit a DNS request to the DNS server and wait for a complete response. Many DNS servers perform recursion.|
|Iterative|Iterative is the process by which a DNS server requests information from the request to another DNS server.|
|Delegation|Delegation is the process by which a DNS server hands responsibility for the request to another DNS server.|
|DNS forwarders|A forwarder is a DNS server on an internal network configured to forward DNS queries for the external DNS names to DNS servers on other domains or outside the network. External DNS names could exist in other domains, other networks, or on the internet.|
|Root hints|If a DNS forward is not configured, the internal network DNS server will use root hints of external DNS names to a root-level DNS server on the internet. By default, DNS servers are configured with a root hints list that contains the addresses of all the root-level DNS servers on the internet.  <br><br>If your organization's security requires that your internal network not be connected to the internet, you should configure an internal DNS server as authoritative for root(.), and then configure the root hints list on other internal DNS servers with an entry for that server. Also, remove the default root hints list from those DNS servers.|

### DNS Resolution Process
You should be familiar with the DNS name resolution process that occurs on the client and the server:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Location|Process|
|Client|The process for DNS name resolution on the client is as follows:<br><br>1. Entries in the Hosts file are preloaded into the cache.<br>    - The host file is located in the **c:\windows\\system32\drives\etc** folder.<br>    - All changes to the hosts file are made manually. To change the hosts file, open the file in notepad with elevate privilege and make the changes.<br>    - You should use the hosts file only when you want to direct the DNS to a host different than the host listed on the DNS server.<br>    - You may want use the host file if you cannot remove an entry from the DNS.<br>2. The client examines its local DNS cache for the IP address. The cache holds hostnames that the client has resolved in the past. Entries stay in memory for a short time so that the hostnames in the cache are periodically resolved.<br>3. If the IP address is not in the cache, the client sends the request to the DNS server.|
|Server|The process for the DNS name resolution on the server is as follows:  <br><br>1. A DNS name resolution request is forwarded to a DNS server.<br>2. The DNS server examines its local DNS cache for the IP address. To clear the DNS server cache, use the **DNScmd /clear cache** command.<br>3. If the name is not resolved using the local DNS cache and the DNS server is authoritative, the DNS server responds using information in the zone hosted on the server. If the DNS server is not authoritative but is configured for forwarding or conditional forwarding, the DNS server forwards the request.<br>    <br>    The DNS server cache is not the same as the client cache. Windows Server 2008 and later has a DNS client cache, but this cache is not used to respond to client requests.<br>    <br>4. If forwarding fails or the DNS server cannot forward the request, the DNS server uses its root hints file, which is also known as Cache.dns. The root hints file lists the known DNS server.<br>    <br>    www.Root-Servers.org lists the root servers and displays a map of their locations.<br>    <br>5. The root DNS server responds with the address of a .com, .edu, .net, or other DNS server, depending on the request.<br>6. The DNS server forwards the request to the high-level DNS server, which can respond with a variety of IP addresses.|

Keep in mind the following facts about root hints and the root zone:

- The root zone is at the top of the DNS hierarchy and is represented as a dot ( . ).
- The root servers delegate portions of the DNS database to servers below them. Delegation continues downward until the IP address of the host is found.
- If you have a root zone configured on a DNS server, the server will act as a root zone server.
- A DNS server configured as a root zone server will never use the root hints. It considers itself authoritative. Consequently, the server won't access the internet to forward DNS queries.
- If you want the DNS server to access the internet, delete the root zone in the DNS console.
- You configure root hints through a DNS server's properties.
