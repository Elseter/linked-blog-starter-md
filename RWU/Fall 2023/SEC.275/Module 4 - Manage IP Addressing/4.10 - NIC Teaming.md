# 4.10 - NIC Teaming
---
## 4.10.3-  NIC Teaming Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:
- NIC Teaming benefits
- NIC Teaming modes
- Load balancing modes

### NIC Teaming Benefits
NIC Teaming allows two or more network adapters to be combined into a single virtual network adapter to work together as a team. NIC Teaming is sometimes referred to as Load Balancing or Failover (LBFO) and provides the following benefits:

- Load balancing: Traffic is split between the network adapters evenly.
- Fault tolerance: Functioning network adapters automatically take over if one network adapter goes down.
- Simplified network configuration: All connections to the server use only one IP address.

Be aware of the following regarding NIC Teaming:

- Up to 32 network adapters can be combined into a single team.
- Each network adapter is known as a team member.
- The virtual network adapter that is created is known as the team interface.
- Only the team interface is assigned an IP address.
- The NIC team appears as a single network adapter to the operating system and network.
- NIC Teams can be created using either Server Manager or PowerShell. In PowerShell:
    - Use the New-NetSwitchTeam cmdlet to create NIC Teams.
    - Use the Remove-NetLbfoTeam cmdlet to break up a NIC Team.

### NIC Teaming Modes
When configuring NIC Teaming, you configure the teaming mode. The following table describes switch related modes.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|NIC Teaming Mode|Description|
|Switch independent|Allows the NIC Team to connect to multiple non-stacked switches. The switches are not aware of the NIC team and use the MAC address to determine where to send traffic.<br><br>- No configuration on the switches is necessary in this mode.<br>- Additional fault-tolerance can be achieved by assigning one team member as an active adapter and another NIC as a standby adapter.<br>    - The standby adapter is not used unless the active NIC goes down. At that point, the standby adapter takes over.<br>    - This mode is not used very often since it reduces the bandwidth that can be attained.|
|Switch dependent|The switch dependent modes require additional configuration on each switch. The two switch dependent modes are:<br><br>- Static Mode: In this mode, each port on the switch that connects to a NIC team is manually configured into a link aggregation group (LAG).<br>    - The server and switch work together to split the traffic evenly between the connected links.<br>    - When a link is connected to another device or LAG, traffic will still be sent down that link which makes it difficult to isolate any incorrectly plugged cables.<br>- Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP): LACP mode is identical to static mode, except LACP mode ensures that each link is properly connected.<br>    - When a link is improperly connected, no traffic will go down that link.<br>    - LACP is also known as the IEEE 802.1AX standard.<br><br>When using a switch dependent mode, the host must be connected to a single switch or a single switch stack.|

### Load Balancing Modes
You must also configure the Load Balancing Mode, also known as the Traffic Distribution Algorithms. The following table describes each of these modes:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Load Balancing Mode|Description|
|Address Hash|This method creates a hash for the packets and sends it with the packets to an available network adapter. The hash is generated using one of the following:  <br><br>- Source and destination IP addresses and ports. This is the default mode and results in the best load balancing results.<br>- Source and destination IP addresses only.<br>- Source and destination MAC addresses only.<br><br>Keep the following in mind regarding Address Hash modes:<br><br>- You can configure the mode manually if needed. If you are using only the IP addresses or MAC addresses, you must use PowerShell to configure the NIC Team.<br>- Address hashing is unable to automatically load balance if a network adapter is being over/under-utilized.<br>- When you use address hashing, all traffic from the same TCP stream is sent to the same network adapter.|
|Hyper-V Port|This mode is used with virtual machines running in Hyper-V. Each virtual machine is assigned a MAC address which is then assigned to a team member.<br><br>- The advantage to this method is that the switch balances the traffic based on the MAC address for the virtual machine (VM).<br>- A disadvantage is that the virtual machine is limited to the bandwidth of a single adapter.<br>- Choose Hyper-V switch port if there are multiple virtual network cards in the VM teamed in the guest operating system.<br><br>When using NIC Teaming with Hyper-V:<br><br>- Each external switch can use only one team.<br>- An adapter connecting the VM to the network can't be part of a NIC Team. The NIC Team must be created first and then the Hyper-V network can be created.<br>- Hyper-V can't create networks based on individual adapters in a team.|
|Dynamic|Dynamic mode was introduced in Server 2012 and is the default mode in today's networks. Dynamic mode combines the best parts of the Address Hash and Hyper-V modes:  <br><br>- Inbound traffic is split by assigning team members to different MAC addresses like in the Hyper-V mode.<br>- Outbound traffic is split by using a hash generated using the source and destination IP addresses and ports like in the Address Hash mode.<br><br>Dynamic mode is able to monitor all traffic. When a team member is being under/over-utilized, the algorithm can adjust traffic to provide the best load balancing possible.  <br>  <br>Dynamic load balancing will also monitor TCP flowlets to anticipate the team members that might have a spike or drop in traffic. It adjusts traffic before the spike or drop happens.<br><br>A flowlet is a burst of packets that is separated from other bursts. You predefine the idle time gap.|
