## 4.6.10 - Advanced DHCP Management Facts

DHCP is a crucial part of any network. DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses and other information that makes communication on the internet and network possible. Because DHCP is such an integral component of a network, it is imperative that it is accessible at all times.

This lesson covers the following topics:
- DHCP high availability
- DHCP filtering  
    

### DHCP High Availability
It is common in many networks to have more than one server configured to handle DHCP functions or provide DHCP redundancy. In Microsoft Server 2008 and earlier, the following options were available to configure the servers to provide DHCP high availability:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|DHCP High Availability Options|Description|
|Splitting the DHCP scope|Splitting the DHCP scope between two servers was probably the most common high availability implementation used. In this setup, the main server is assigned a percentage of the DHCP scope and the backup server was assigned the rest of the scope.<br><br>- When the main server went down, the backup server would take over and assign IP configurations from its assigned scope range.<br>- This option was not too difficult to implement, but did have drawbacks including:<br>    - Backup servers that already had a large number of addresses and couldn't handle the additional load.<br>    - The servers did not share information on active leases. When the main server went down, devices couldn't keep their current IP configuration because the backup server didn't have that information.|
|Windows failover cluster|A failover cluster consisted of two servers with a shared storage between them. When the main server failed, the backup server took over with minimal downtime or interruption. A failover cluster worked well, but did have drawbacks including:<br><br>- It is difficult and time consuming to configure a server cluster.<br>- The shared storage was a single point of failure. Backup storage could be used for redundancy, but this involved additional cost and effort.<br><br>A failover cluster can be configured for most server roles, not only DHCP.|

To help address the issues with these high availability options, Microsoft introduced DHCP Failover in Server 2012. DHCP Failover uses two servers to provide high availability. The key difference from earlier options is that the cluster doesn't have to be configured and there is no shared storage. Failover offers the following benefits:

- Simplicity: Microsoft included a wizard that walks the system administrator through the process of configuring the DHCP failover relationship between the servers.
- Seamless: When the main server fails, the clients shouldn't notice a drop in connectivity and will maintain the same IP configuration when renewing the lease. The servers share the current DHCP lease information.
- Multi-Site Configuration: You can place DHCP servers across multiple physical locations.
- Flexibility: You can configure the DHCP failover relationship to use hot standby mode or load balance mode. The system can switch between the modes, but only one mode can be active at a time. This provides greater flexibility in the configuration and operation of the DHCP service.

The following table describes these two modes.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|DHCP Failover Mode|Description|
|Hot standby|In hot standby mode, you manually assign the main server a percentage of IP leases. By default, this is 95%. If the main server goes down, the backup server takes over handling the DHCP functions until the main server can be brought back online.  <br>  <br>As part of the failover configuration, the Maximum client lead time (MCLT) parameter is configured. The MCLT is the maximum amount of time the backup server waits before assuming control over the entire scope. Key facts regarding hot standby mode include:  <br><br>- While the backup server is actively handling leases, clients that need to renew an existing IP configuration have the configuration renewed. However, the IP configuration is assigned only for the MCLT duration, not the typical lease time.<br>- During the MCLT duration, the standby server will issue new leases as long as it has available leases from its reserve pool.<br>- When the main server is back up by the time the MCLT duration expires, the backup server continues to renew already assigned leases and assigns new leases from the entire available IP address pool.<br><br>Hot standby mode is ideal for smaller networks where one server can easily handle the bulk of the DHCP functions without getting overloaded.|
|Load balance|This is the default DHCP Failover mode. Both servers are typically assigned 50% of the IP leases, but you can adjust this as needed. When a client requests an IP configuration, a hash is generated using the client's MAC address. Each server is assigned a range of hashes that they will handle. This range of hashes is known as the hash bucket.  <br>  <br>When one of the servers goes down:<br><br>- The other server continues assigning IP configurations to all clients.<br>- When a client that received its original IP configuration from the down server requests a lease renewal, the server renews the lease for the duration of the MCLT.<br>- The server continues assigning IP configurations until its scope is exhausted. Then, it starts assigning IP configurations from the down server's scope.<br>- Once the MCLT duration has passed, the running server automatically assumes responsibility for the entire scope.|

### DHCP Filtering
DHCP filtering uses a client's MAC address to determine whether the client is allowed on the network. You can configure the following options for DHCP filtering:

- Allow: All clients in this list are automatically assigned a DHCP configuration. The DHCP server rejects any clients not in this list.
- Deny: No clients in this list will be assigned an IP configuration.

The Deny list always take precedence over the Allow list. If a MAC address is in both lists, that client won't be assigned an IP configuration.
