## 4.3.3 - Network Communication Troubleshooting Facts
This lesson covers the ping troubleshooting process.

### Ping Troubleshooting Process
Identifying the scope of a problem is a critical step in the troubleshooting process. To help you understand the troubleshooting process, consider the following reported connectivity problem.

Workstation A (on the local network) can't communicate with Workstation C.

![Example network for troubleshooting scenario. Workstations A though E connecting via routers to the cloud](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_5011/serverhybridcore2022v5-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_trouble_network_comm_shc5/pingtest.jpg)

The following table lists tasks to troubleshoot the reported connectivity problem. These steps trace the problem backward from the remote host to the local host. Depending on the situation, you might be able to troubleshoot the problem more efficiently by skipping some tasks or changing the order that you perform them. You might even complete them in reverse order. You are workstation A.

|Task|Description|
|Ping host C|Often, the best way to start troubleshooting a problem is to ping the host you are trying to contact. This verifies the reported problem. If the ping is successful, the problem is not related to network connectivity. In that case, check other problems, such as name resolution or service access.<br><br>If you have access to another computer, try pinging the destination host from that computer. If the ping is successful, skip the remaining tasks and troubleshoot the local host configuration or physical connection.|
|Ping host D|If you can't contact a specific remote host, try pinging another host in the same remote network. If the ping is successful, the problem is with the remote host. For example, the problem could be a misconfiguration, broken link, or unavailable host.|
|Ping host E|If you can't contact any host in the remote network, try pinging hosts on other remote networks (try several other networks). If the pings are successful or if you can contact some remote networks and not others, the problem is with the routing path between the network and the remote network.  <br>  <br>Use the tracert (Windows) or traceroute (Mac) command to check the path to the problem network.|
|Ping the default gateway|If you can't contact any remote network, ping the default gateway router. If the ping is successful but you still can't contact any remote host, have the router administrator verify the router configuration. Check for:<br><br>- Broken links to the remote network.<br>- Interfaces that have been shut down.<br>- Access control lists or other controls that might be blocking traffic.|
|Ping host B|If you can't contact the default gateway router, ping other hosts on the local network. If the pings are successful, check the default gateway router.|
|Troubleshoot the local host connection or configuration|If you can't communicate with any host on the local network, the problem is likely with the local host or its connection to the network. Troubleshoot by doing the following:<br><br>- Check physical connectivity.<br>- Validate the TCP/IP configuration on the local host.<br>- Validate IP configuration settings.|

The route command can be useful in troubleshooting. You can use the route command on the router to view directly connected routes that have been set up. You can also use it on the default gateway of the local subnet to verify that the router has a route to the remote subnet. Additionally, you can use the route command to:

- View the routing table; this helps you see the networks the router knows about.
- Display additional networking information not provided by ifconfig.

One special ping test you can perform is pinging the local host. By doing this, you are verifying that TCP/IP is correctly installed and configured on the local host. You are verifying the workstation can communicate with itself.

To ping the local host, use the following command:

> ping 127.0.0.1

If this test fails, check to make sure TCP/IP is correctly configured on the system.

This test does not check physical connectivity. The ping can succeed even if the host is disconnected from the network.
