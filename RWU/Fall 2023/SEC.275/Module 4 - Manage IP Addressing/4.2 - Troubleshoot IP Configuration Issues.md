## 4.2.3 - IP Configuration Troubleshooting Facts
This lesson covers Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) required configuration settings.

### TCP/IP Required Configuration Settings
The following table summarizes the configuration settings required to connect to a TCP/IP network.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Parameter|Purpose|
|IP address|The IP address identifies both the logical host and the logical network addresses.<br><br>- Each host on the entire network must have a unique IP address.<br>- Two devices on the same subnet must have IP addresses with the same network portion of the address.<br>- Two devices on the same subnet must have unique host portions of the IP address.<br>- You can't use the first or the last host address on a subnet address range.|
|Subnet mask|The subnet mask identifies the portion of the IP address that is the network address, and the portion that is the host address. Two devices on the same subnet must be configured with the same subnet mask.|
|Default gateway|The default gateway identifies the router to which communications for remote networks are sent. The default gateway address is the IP address of the router interface on the same subnet as the local host.  <br>  <br>Without a default gateway set, most clients can't communicate with hosts outside of the local subnet.|
|Domain Name System (DNS) server|The DNS server address identifies the DNS server that is used to resolve host names to IP addresses.|
|Host name|The host name identifies the logical name of the local system.|
