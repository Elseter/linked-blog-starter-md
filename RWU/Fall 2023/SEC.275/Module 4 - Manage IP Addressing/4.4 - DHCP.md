# 4.4 - DHCP

## 4.4.2 - DHCP Facts
For a device to communicate on a network, the device must have its Internet Protocol (IP) information configured. This can be done either manually or dynamically (automatically).

- A _static IP_ is an IP address that has been manually configured. This means the address will not change even if the device disconnects from the network.
- A _dynamic IP_ is an IP address that is automatically assigned. The IP configuration is handled by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

This lesson covers the following topics:
- Role of DHCP
- DHCP configuration
- DHCP process

### Role of DHCP
Implementing DHCP on a network allows the IP configuration to be assigned automatically when a device connects to the network. The IP configuration can include:
- Unique IP address.
- Subnet mask.
- Default gateway.
- Domain Name System (DNS) server (only if needed).
- Windows Naming Service (WINS) server (only if needed).

### DHCP Configuration

To implement DHCP, the DHCP scope must be defined. This is the configuration information that will be applied to each device receiving an IP configuration though DHCP.

Depending on the network, different devices can serve as the DHCP server such as:
- SOHO router
- Windows or Linux server

The following table describes each option that needs to be defined in a DHCP scope.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|DHCP Scope|Description|
|IP range|The IP range defines the range of IP addresses that the DHCP server can assign. When a new device connects to the network, the DHCP server assigns the next available address.  <br>  <br>When defining the IP range:<br><br>- All available addresses in the network can be assigned.<br>- Only specific ranges can be assigned (e.g., 192.168.5.50 - 192.168.5.100).<br><br>Specifying a limited number of addresses can help limit the number of connections to the network.|
|Subnet mask|The subnet mask defines the network ID and host ID. The subnet mask must be defined.|
|Exclusions|Exclusions are IP addresses that the DHCP server will not assign. Be aware that exclusion addresses:<br><br>- Are typically used for devices such as servers, printers, routers, or other network devices that must have a static IP address.<br>- Must be manually configured on each device. It's important to remember that the exclusion addresses must fall within the configured IP range of the scope.|
|Reservations|Reservations are static IP addresses that are not dynamically assigned by the DHCP server.<br><br>- Reservations are assigned by the DHCP server using the device's MAC address.<br>- Whenever the device with the specified MAC address connects to the network, the DHCP server assigns it the reserved static IP configuration.|
|DHCP lease time|When a device is assigned an IP configuration, it is for a specified amount of time. This is the DHCP lease.<br><br>- While a lease is active, that IP address can't be reassigned, even if the device disconnects from the network.<br>- When the lease is half over, a device still connected to the network will attempt to renew the lease.<br><br>A lease can be set for a few hours up to many days, weeks, or months.<br><br>- If the device stays connected to the network, set the lease to last for days.<br>- If clients are connecting for only a short period of time (e.g., a guest network), set the lease accordingly so available addresses aren't tied up.|
|Default gateway|The default gateway defines where data packets that are leaving the network should go. An example is packets going to the internet are sent to the default gateway.|
|DNS server|If a specific DNS server is being used, define it in the scope.|
|WINS server|Most networks do not use WINS anymore. If it is needed, you can define it in the DHCP scope.|

### DHCP Process
When a new device connects to the network, it goes through a four-step process to obtain the IP configuration from the DHCP server. The four steps in the process are: discover, offer, request, and acknowledge. The acronym DORA is a useful memory aid. The following table describes the DORA process.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|DHCP Process|Description|
|DHCP discover (D)|The client begins by sending a DHCP discover frame to identify DHCP servers on the network.|
|DHCP offer (O)|A DHCP server that receives a discover request from a client responds with a DHCP offer advertisement that contains an available IP address.  <br>  <br>If more than one DHCP server responds with an offer, the client usually responds to the first offer that it receives.|
|DHCP request (R)|The client accepts the offered address by sending a DHCP request back to the DHCP server.  <br>  <br>If multiple offers were sent, the DHCP request message from the client also informs the other DHCP servers that their offers were not accepted. They can make the IP address in the offers available to other clients.|
|DHCP ACK (A)|The DHCP server whose offer was accepted responds to the request by sending a DHCP ACK (acknowledgement). At this point, the IP address is leased to and configured on the DHCP client.|

The DHCP renewal process occurs when fifty percent of the device's lease time has expired. This process skips the DHCP discover and DHCP offer steps. The client sends the DHCP request packet to the server which responds with the DHCP Ack packet and renews the IP configuration.

When the client attempts to renew its lease, the DHCP server will try to reassign the same IP information. However, if the client is off the network for an extended period and the lease expires, that address goes back into the pool and can be reassigned to another device.
