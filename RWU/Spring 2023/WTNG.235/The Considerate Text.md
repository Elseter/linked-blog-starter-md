1. First Impression
2. Heft
3. Convention
4. Chunking
5. External Skeleton
6. Consistency
7. Expense
8. Attraction
9. Interpretation
10. Style

### First Impression
- Rather self explanatory, this is the first impression a document leaves upon its reader. 
- This may include the fonts used, the paper the document it printed on
- A well designed and presented document will lend more credibility to its author and has a greater likelihood of convincing the reader to trust the author, even when this is possibly underserved
- Sets the tone for the entire document
- Be wary that creating a professional document in appearance will also raise audience expectations 

### Heft
- a concept similar to the bulk or length of a document
- A phone book has large heft, a post it note has very little heft
- Excessive heft may discourage readers from engaging with the document
- The heft of a document should reflect the complexity of the material being discussed
- This is of greater importance with hard copies of documents where readers may see the entirety of a document prior to reading (IE first impression of the heft)
- Heft has size, shape, quantity, and often, weight factors

### Convention
- what readers expect from the appearance of a document
- consists of expectations based on what we have seen before in documents 
- cues the reader in as to what to expected based on what the reader has read before and the similarities and difference present
- affronting convention may alienate the audience

### Chunking
- writers may visually help readers through a document by arranging a text into discrete visual parts
- provides visual relief rather than a continuous flow of information
- Breaking down into paragraphs and headings falls within chunking

### External Skeleton
- Readers assess the organization of a document based on its external skeleton
- includes page numbers, headings, table of contents, running headers or footers, paragraph indentations, and chapter markers 
- relies on convention and chunking

### Consistency
- the reader's tendency to see unity in a document that maintains a consistent style or tone
- the formatting of a document (MLA for example), will greatly aid in consistency if its formatting is followed
- a formal tone should not be accompanied by clip art images 

### Expense
- The expense of paper, printing, and visuals
- the amount that the document is dressed up and feel of expenditure

### Attraction
- The ability to maintain readers once engaged, guiding them through the document, and if needed, to its end
- compelling the reader to continue and see what is next

### Interpretation
- applies to tables, graphs, and photos
- interpret the results present in these tables, graphs and photos
- Don't leave interpretation up to your reader

### Style
- visual style
