## Heaven for Everyone: Westernization, Change, and Anthropology

### Culture Change
- Understanding cultural change is an important part of understanding globalization (our primary goal)
- There are several types of cultural change and many models for how people learn and adapt
- What model did we go over for learning culture?

#### Mechanisms of Change
- Primary Innovation
- Secondary Innovation
- Diffusion

##### Primary Innovation
- Primary innovation is the creation, invention, or change discovery of a new completely new idea, method or device
- Who can think of examples of Primary Innovation in history

##### Secondary Innovation
- Secondary innovation is the deliberate application or modification of an existing idea, method, or device
- Examples of this are somewhat more difficult to come up with, but can you?
	- Chinese invention of gunpowder (which was then spread through diffusion)
	- Eventually it got to Europe where the earlier guns were eventually replaced by flint locks, and many other types of weapons

##### Diffusion
- Diffusion is the spread of certain ideas, customs, or practices from one culture to another
- We have already talked about this when we talked about Boas
- This is essentially people borrowing ideas from one another
- Examples
	- Many plants including:
		- Maize, Wheat, Tomatoes, Potatoes, Coffee, and Tea
	- Technology including:
		- Gunpowder, Sneakers, Radios, Doritos, Pepsi products, and Anime
	- Ideology:
		- Democracy, Capitalism, Communism, and Religions

#### Cultural Loss
- Cultural loss is the abandonment of an existing practice of trait
- Usually this is the replacement of one trait by a newer or better one (better at least in the eyes of the culture)
- Sometimes, however, this is simply forgetting some technology
- Get into groups and think about examples of this

- Examples
	- peoples of the Canary Islands forgot how to make and use boats. They obviously had boats to get there, but they were not needed, and then the technology for making them was forgotten. This was likely due to the lack of good stone for making the stone tools required in carpentry (and boat making)

##### Repressive Change
- Repressive Changes are those cultural changes which come about involuntarily. This is when one culture forces change upon another culture
- This can be done by political pressure or military force

##### Ethnocide
- Ethnocide is the violent eradication of an ethnic group's collective cultural identity

### Case study of Cultural Change: Saami Reindeer Herders
- The Saami are Reindeer Herders (therefore gaining their subsistence as Pastoralists)
- The Saami live in Norway, Finland, Sweden and Russia
- In the 1960's they began adopting new technologies such as Snow Mobile

#### The end of Saami Tradition?
- Because they began to use snow mobiles, they became much more dependent on having actual cash. They found that snowmobiles are expensive to maintain and lost traditional cultural skills (how to herd reindeer without the snow mobiles)
- Men had to start getting jobs outside the community

#### How did this affect their herding practices
- The introduction of the snow mobile greatly changed their herding practices
- Instead of silently approaching and helping the reindeer to forage, people now appeared quickly on noisy smelly machines quickly slaughtering members of the herd then leaving
- Snow mobiles seem to have adversely affected birthing rate among the reindeer
