# Kinship from an Evolutionary Perspective
---
## What is Kinship
- Kinship is a culturally defined system that defines the rights and obligations that you have to people you are related to
- Your kinship system includes people that are both genetically related to you and those that are not genetically related to you
- Kinship is another cultural universal

## What Kinship Does
- Kin systems define the relationships you have with kin
- Provides a system of mutual aid for those within the system
- Defines inheritance of goods and titles (if there is ascribed status)
- Mandates who takes care of and teaches children

### Though not in your book
- Though it is not a conscious of kin systems (or the people within them). Kinship provides an easy method to keep track of who you share genetic material with
- Evolutionary theory posits that we want to pass on our genetic traits; thus kinship provides a quick way to figure out who shares the most genetic material with you and therefore who you should help

## Ultimately Kinship does what
- Kinship systems allow you to organize people into two groups: kin and non-kin
- Within your kin, kinship systems allow you to rank and understand the importance of the relationship between you and your kin

### Hamilton's Rule
- Hamilton posited that you are more likely to help your kin than any other people
- Evolutionary speaking this is a good choice
	- Continue to pass along your genes

#### Hamilton's Rule Formula
- Essentially you could find out (on average) how related you are to another person
- Shown on the board how to do this

#### The Formula
- rB>C
	- Where r = the genetic relatedness of the recipient to the actor
	- Where B = the additional reproductive benefit of the act
	- Where C = the reproductive cost of the act

## Two Types of Kin
- Affinal Kin: Kin who are related to you by marriage
	- Brothers-in-law, Sister-in-Law, non blood uncles, step children, step children
- Sanguinal (blood) kin: Kin who you share a genetic relationship with
