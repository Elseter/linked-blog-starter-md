## Questions (5 will be selected)
### Question 1
**1) What are the two traits that all primates share and why do we have them?**

All primates have a variety of teeth (including incisors, canines, premolars and molars). Additionally, all primates have highly developed vision that is both binocular and stereoscopic 
- Gives us depth perception
	- Allowed primates to jump from tree to tree

### Question 2
**2) What were Neanderthals like? What is one theory of what could have happened to them?**

Neanderthals were bigger and more muscular than us. They had brow ridges and much larger noses (wider). Cranial capacity around 1,400 cc's (as large and sometimes larger than hours). They hunted for their meals. Used similar tools to early humans and likely shared tools between each other. They also had scrappers.
- Theory: They were too cold adapted and the shifting climate killed them (linked with us outcompeting them)
- Theory 2: We are them (they interbred with us)
	- This is backed by the sequencing of the Neanderthal nuclear DNA genome

### Question 3
**3) What are some of the reasons that we think pre-humans adapted to walk on two legs (bipedally)?**

This allowed early pre-humans to see further in the newly formed savannah. They could reach higher and carry materials. They had less surface area exposed to the sun. Catch more wind, disappear heat better. Increased endurance. Greater finger dexterity.
- At the cost of hand durability
- made childbirth more difficult


### Question 4
**4) Where did Humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) start? Where did we go from there and in what order (roughly) did we go there?**

Modern Homo sapiens sapiens likely first appeared in  southern/ central Africa around 200,000 years ago. 
- Then to northern Africa, then to Asia through what is now the modern day middle east. 
- Glaciers keep early humans from going more north, but they go east and west. 
- Before the glaciers retreat, humans made their way to Australia as great deals of sea water was still locked up within glaciers
- As the glaciers retreated, humans made their way from north Eastern Asia across a land bridge to the americas
- Finally populate other islands over time


### Question 5
**5) What is the major factor that determines how many material goods Hunter-gatherers own? What are the two types of Gatherer-Hunter groups that Binford came up with?** 

Hunter-Gatherers had to live off of the land and were typically very mobile. This resulted in them often moving to follow the areas with the greatest resources. Being so mobile, they were forced to carry very little in the way of material goods
- Binford (1960) proposed two forms of mobility:
	1. Residential - Moving of their entire base camp from one type of resource to the next
		- Works well with scattered patches of resources
		- Often more people
	1. Logistical - Moving their base camp (less often) from one group of resources to the next and then sending out task groups


### Question 6
**6) Compare the Class system that we currently live within to the Class system of the Salish peoples of the Northwest coast.**

- Picture likely not included in exam

- Falls apart in the late 18th hundreds
- The US class system is essentially a pyramid, with the wealthiest up top and the lest wealthy at the bottom
- to become a leader, you give away things of value to other good people which elects you into a leader
- To become a good person, you have access to natural resources, typically through lineage
- Worthless people had no resources, but could rise to become good people by leaving and create their own village
- Slaves can be freed and become worthless people
- Bad leaders can be thrown all the way down to the bottom, becoming slaves through violence

### Question 7
**7) What do Anthropologists study?** 

They study human culture and behavior. There are 4 subfields, all study culture
1. Cultural
2. Evolutionary/Biological
3. Linguistic
4. Archaeology

### Question 8
**8) What do Psychologists study?** 

The scientific study of our thoughts, feelings and behaviors
1. Behavioral
2. Biological
3. Evolutionary
4. Developmental
5. Psychodynamic

### Question 9
**9) What do Sociologists study?** 

Sociology is the scientific study of human society and social interactions. Often they deal with understanding common sense assumptions and theoretically attempt to understand and explain their observations on common sense

### Question 10
**10) How might storage indicate that a society has gone through the beginnings of social inequality?**

When storage starts to become individual or communal? If the storage is individual, do certain individuals have more than others. Do individuals have a surplus of goods resulting in individual control over a resource. This results in them having differential power
