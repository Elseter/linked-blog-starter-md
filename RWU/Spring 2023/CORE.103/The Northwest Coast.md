# The Northwest Coast
---
## Where
- We will be focusing on northern Washington state and British Columbia
- Split into the south coast (Oregon), central coast (Washington/British Columbia) and the north coast (British Columbia to Alaska)

### Environment
- It rains a lot. Coastal with both marine and forest resources available throughout the northwest coast 
- Plenty of wood for fire, houses, and tools
- Plenty of terrestrial mammals
- Plenty of plants (even though the use of these is often under estimated)

### More on Environment
- Most people live along the coast are near the rivers which drain into the Pacific Ocean
- There is an extraordinary amount of coastline as the Northern Pacific Coast has many barrier islands
- This allows for easy travel up and down the rivers as well as from island to island via boats
	- The straits between islands are sometimes difficult to navigate but can be traversed if you have the proper knowledge 

### Resources are plentiful
- Salmon runs occur every fall and the location and timing of each species can be predicted
- Therefore with enough people Salmon can easily be taken such that they last throughout the winter
	- Winters were not very harsh
- There are also a multitude of sea mammals, terrestrial mammals (such as deer) and bird resources along the coast

### The Nature of Coasts
- High and Low Tide
	- These are significant changes to the environment that occur on a daily basis on a beach
	- "When the tide is out the table is set"
	- Low tide means that you can gather mussels, shellfish, and drift wood
	- Low tide is an easy meal for hunter gatherers and we can see it in the immense shell middens that accompany sites

### Water Transport
- The peoples of the Northwest Coast had boats. As such river-ways and waterways between the many islands acted as a kind of super highway allowing the quick movement of people up and around the various islands and coasts of the mainland
- This resulted in increased interactions between the villages of the Northwest Cost and increased movement, warfare, and trading

### Salmonopeia
- intensity of late period salmon use many archaeologists have been accused of overlooking the other resources available to the people of the Northwest Coast
- Salmon was highly important
	- but there were other resources available as well

### Namu
- Excavated from 1969-1994
- A variety of archaeologists have worked here 
	- Roy Carlson and Aubrey Cannon
- Occupied from 9,000 B.P on and possibly even early as 11,000 B.P
- This site is important on the Northwest Coast due to its extended occupation and arguments for early storage

### Excavation in the Midden
- What is a midden?
	- Where previous cultures disposed of their waste
	- Archaeological feature including the waste product from a site. On the Northwest coast the soil of a midden in so organic is darkened and stands out from the rest of the site
	- At times the midden is as much shell as it is dirt. Other things that can be in a midden include blowfish spines, terrestrial mammal bone, debitage, artifacts, and even burials of lower class people

#### Namu and Storage
- Carlson and Cannon argue that there is evidence for very early storage on the Northwest Coast at Namu
- It is argued that it was a winter camp
- the most frequent species of Salmon was pink
	- It was the easiest to store

## The Gulf of Georgia
- Northwest corner of Washington state
- Much of the research and models for the Northwest Coast were developed here

### Locarno Beach
- 3,500 - 2,400 B.P
- Earliest reliable (non-Namu) evidence for storage
- Typically only found on islands not on mainland
- Various type of harpoons toggling and non-toggling
- Labret wearing indicates achieved status
	- can be removed and put back in

### Marpole Period
- 2,400 - 1,000 B.P
- Appearance of cranium deformation (signaling inherited status)
- Marked increase in social complexity
- Marpole period unilateral harpoons
- Labrets disappear as status markers
- Peer exchanged networks
- Defensive structures and locations selected for settlement

#### Cranial Deformation
- This process is done to infants
- Something is placed against their head while they are on cradle boards tp flatten and elongate their foreheads
	- Social status?
	- Aesthetic?
	- Ethnic identity?

### Plank Houses
- The planks are transportable
- When Europeans came to the area they reported seeing the remaining frames of houses
- As Northwest Coast people moved from on place to the next they would leave the frame and take the planks with them
	- What the Europeans were seeing were actually just the frames

#### Houses and Households
- Houses are the physical houses in which people lived
- Households were the groups of family that inhabited one or several houses. These people worked together as a production unit and were often related
- Due to the fact that Northwest Coast people thought of kin bilaterally (meaning they considered both their mothers and fathers side) people could live with either the Household of their mother and father

### Ascribed vs Achieved Status
- Ascribed Status
	- Status based on birthright or actions of parents
	- Not earned but inherited
- Achieved Status
	- Big men among Gatherer-Hunter
	- Status is earned through action

### Status on the Northwest Coast

### Potlatches
- Are feasts that are sponsored by the elite
- These continue onto the ethnographic present
- Essentially everyone gets together and the host gives them food and items
- By giving the participants items and food the hosts status s increased
- Sometimes items are even thrown into the ocean or destroyed instead of being given away
- Serve to give away wealth keeping any one person from accumulation a lot of stuff
- To gain status they have to give things away or destroy them


Did a big person step up and take charge?
If so, why did you listen to them? If not, why do you think that didn't happen
