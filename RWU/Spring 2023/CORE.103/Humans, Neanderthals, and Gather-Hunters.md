# Humans, Neanderthals, and Gather-Hunters
---
## Continuing our Story
- Modern Homo sapiens sapiens likely appeared first in Africa around 200,000 years ago
	- Therefore, we have not yet lasted as long as any of our ancestors as a species yet
- We were not, however, the only people on the scene. Homo neanderthalensis
	- They were actually not as old as us, living from 125,000 - 30,000 years ago
	- but did not start or ever live in Africa

## Neanderthals Physically
- Neanderthals were bigger and more muscular than us
- They still had brow ridges
- Much larger noses (wider)
- Average cranial capacity around 1,400 CC's
	- As large and sometimes larger than hours

## Cultural Traits of Neanderthals at Shanidar Cave
- Nine burials ranging in age from 60,000 - 80,000 years B.P. (Before Present)
- A tenth skeleton was found later
- One of the burials was of an elderly individual who had been injured several times
- Proof that Neanderthals valued those that were injured and too old to work (this is not apparent in human ancestors)

## Cultural Traits of Neanderthals at Shanidar Cave
- Pollen from the Cave indicates that within burial 4, flowers were left in the grave
- The flowers could have been medicinal
	- What does this suggest
	- Some have suggest a rodent brought the flower pollen down
	- Likely the inspiration for Clan of the Cave Bear

## Other technological and cultural achievements
- Symbolic art-Mammoth tooth which had been carved and colored
- The tooth was handled often and had no functional uses
- It was smeared with Red Ochre
- Neanderthals may also been the first people to make musical instruments

## Mousterian Style Stone tools 
- Humans and Neanderthals both made a tool type known as Mousterian tools
- Much smaller and better made than Achelean tools. Made on flake blanks instead of making tools straight from the core
- A greater variety of tools including not just bifaces, but scrapers, burins, and backed knifes

## The Levallois technique
- Shows pre-planning and several stages of knapping

## A note of SOME of the things which were hunted
- Neanderthals and Early Humans likely hunted anything they could
- This includes modern mammals, but also ice age animal that no longer exist including megafauna

### What are Megafauna
- Mammoths, Mastodonts, and Gomphotheres were all elephant like and are now extinct
- Also there were Giant sloth, Dire Wolves and Dire Beavers

## What Happened to the Neanderthals
- Did we outcompete them?
- They were too cold adapted and the shifting climate killed them (linked with us outcompeting them)
- We are them (They interbred with us)
	- This is backed by the sequencing of the Neanderthal nuclear DNA genome
	- No sign of interbreeding in mtDNA

## Both Neanderthals and Humans were both Gather-Hunters
- Humans have been Gatherer-Hunters from 350,000 - 200,000 years ago to modern times
	- Though they are very few Gatherer-Hunters still existing today
- It should be stressed that Gather-Hunters are not less evolved than there farming friends

## Gatherer-Hunters
- are cultures who use no or very little farming
- They live off the land and are typically mobile
- Usually have very little in the way of material goods
	- Less to carry with them
- This means there is less for archaeologists to study

## Egalitarianism
- Gatherer-Hunters often live in groups of 10-25 people who are "completely equal"
- Usually status and prestige is earned (not ascribed by birthright)
- This is not that they necessarily vote all on issues, but that few people have more than anyone else

## Bands
- People lived in small groups typically containing 25 or less people
	- They are/were typically organized into 5-6 nuclear families
- Political power was in the hand of "Big Women" (or men) who were only in charge as long as the group approved
- People were socially sanctioned through gossip and shunning
	- If you did not like what was going on you voted with your feet

## Man the Hunter Paradigm
- archaeology and especially the theory of, reflects the modern philosophical views of the time
- In the early 50's and 60's towards the end of the cultural historical period of archaeology and even into the Modern (as opposed to post-Modern) paradigm it was assumed that hunting was the paramount form of subsistence
	- The idea was solidified in the "man the hunter" conference in 1966

## Woman The Gatherer
- Throughout ethnographic studies, however, it has been estimated that often as much as 70% if the nutrition for modern Gatherer-Hunters comes from gathering not hunting (this info was gathered through what kind of archaeology)
- Woman the gatherer - book and conference in 1983
	- This book demonstrated in its opening chapter that gathering is more important in 58% of modern Gather-Hunter societies 

## A Simple Guide to Mobility
- Binford (1960) proposed two forms of mobility
	1. Residential - Moving of their entire base camp from one type of resource to the next
	2. Logistical - Moving their base camp from one group of resources to the next and then sending out task groups

## Seasonal Round
- Moving from one group of resources to the next (via residential or logistical mobility)

## Summary of Gather-Hunter Traits
- Limited possessions (because they are constantly on the move)
- Variable leadership positions based on achievements
- The less resources in an area typically the more mobile they are
