# Food Producing Societies
---
## Types of food production/procurement
- Hunting  and Gathering
- Pastoralist
- Horticulture
- Agriculture

### Horticulture
- The production of plant foods with only the use of hand tools
- Often combined with hunting and gathering
- Overall scale of food production is very low
- The Adena, Hopewell, and Basketmaker cultures are New World are examples of groups who did this in the past
- Most peoples modern gardens would be considered horticultural

### Agriculture
- The production of food on a larger scale
- This includes using the labor of large animals, producing far more food than you and your family can consume
- This also often includes irrigation and large scale investment in the plants and soil
- Domestication occurs fully 

### Pastoralist
- Breeding and managing large herds of domesticated animals
- If this is the primary source of food this often include large amounts of movement
- Examples include the Saami, and Nuer

## What is Domestication
- **Domestication** - "Is the evolutionary process whereby humans modify, either intentionally or unintentionally, the genetic make up of a population of plants and/or animals sometimes to the extent that member of the population are unable to survive or reproduce without human assistance " - Haviland

### What happens to a plant when it is domesticated
- Through natural selection the edible/useful portion increases in size
- Loss of method of seed dispersal
- Reproduction of loss of protective husks

#### Example of Teosinte
- **Maize** (Corn) started out a small plant known as teosinte
- As it was domesticated, the fruit of the plant grew much larger and much of the protective husk was lost
- Some think it may have first been used for beer

### What happens to an animal when it is Domesticated
- It gets larger then smaller
- Its typically gets less violent
- Gains fat
- reproduces faster
- Becomes less intelligent
	- exception, working animals, dogs cats

#### What animals domesticate well
- Dumb animals 
- Pack animals 
- Docile animals

## Domesticated Plants
### Old World Plants
- Wheat
- Barley
- Rice
### New World Plants
- Corn (Maize)
- Beans and Squash (the tri-fecta of nutrition)

## Domesticated Animals
### Old World Domesticated Animals
- Ox
- Cow
- Horse
- Dog
- Cat
### New World Domesticated Animals
- The mighty llama
- alpaca
- dog

## Why switch to an Agricultural Society
- Population Density?
	- Hunting and gathering takes up a lot of space what if there is not enough
- Resource Reliability (sometimes)
- Environmental Changes
- Aggrandizing
	- some think that corn was originally grown for beer
- Specialization

### Potential Consequences
- Disease spreads
	- Standing water is caused by agriculture
	- Mosquitos breed in standing water
	- Mosquitos cary disease
	- Domesticated animals spread disease
	- Lots of people in one place facilitate the spread of disease
- Sometimes crops fail... what do you eat
- Its really hard work
- Typically early farmers are less healthy as they eat a lot less variety of foods

### Physical Consequences of Agriculture on people
- Population Increases
	- More incentives, fewer costs
- Physiological
	- Wean earlier to gruels
		- Not breastfed for as long
	- Hormonal suppression
	- Less energy required 
	- Body fat increases
- Health Declines
	- Diseases
	- Nutrition declines
	- Increased Workloads
- Growth interrupted
- Dental Problems
	- Cavities

### Sumpweed theory
- The idea that hunter-gatherers brought back the best plants to camp until the seeds and the remains began to grow in the camp
	- In this way, plants sort of domesticated themselves
- Some plants do quite well in human disturbed soils
- Due to continually gathering the best plants, eventually plant domestication just happens

### Specialization
- When someone grows/produces your food, you can do something else
- While one person farms someone else can make ceramics
	- They get better at farming and you get better at making ceramics such that the quality of your food and your ceramics goes up
- Also people can specialize in non-producing activities such as being a soldier, police officer, religious leader, or a teacher

#### Advantages/Consequences
- The specialist usually becomes better at making the item or preforming the service
	- Meaning that those receiving the item or service receive a higher quality product than if they do it themselves
- Specialization is vital to the development of a state level society and social complexity in general

### Population Aggregation
- The best farming areas are few and far between and once you start farming you can live closer together

### Sedentism
- The opposite of being mobile
- Limits the resources you can have. But also allows you to keep more stuff
- If you are growing your own food you have to stay still to monitor and protect your crops

## The Fertile Crescent
- Was the first of the areas in which plants were domesticated
