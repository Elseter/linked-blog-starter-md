# Modern Primates and Human Evolution
---
## Caveats 
- There is absolutely no proof that human evolution is different for any race or culture
	- Nearly all of human history can be traced to a single group of early humans in Africa
- We are not a genetically diverse species
	- We are all very genetically similar to one another
	- There is no evidence that any race is different from one another in terms of intelligence or capability 

- theory in science means that there is no scientific evidence to disprove its existence
- Share a common ancestor with modern monkeys. but not descended from them

>[! tip] Natural Selection
>The creature that is best adapted to the CURRENT environment will be the most reproductively successful 

## All Primates
- We have a variety of teeth (including incisors, canines, premolars and molars)
	- allows them to eat a variety of things and increase their odds of finding viable food
- Highly Developed vision both binocular and stereoscopic
	- grants us depth perception
	- allowed early primates to jump from tree to tree

### Lemurs and Lorises (Prosimians)
- Most like our common ancestor, haven't evolved much since divergence
- Located on the island of Madagascar and within Asia and Africa
- Hind Leg dominant and larger, Tails are present
- Most like primitive primates
- Still very dependent on smell and live in trees
- Longer Snouts
- Mostly Nocturnal (most other primates are diurnal)
- Scent glands on wrists and anus

### New World Monkeys (Platyrrhine)
- Platyrrhines are the monkey of the New World
	- Central and South America
- Quadrupedal and have a prehensile tail
- Diurnal
- Includes Howler Monkeys, Capuchins

### Old World Monkeys
- Really variable physically and behaviorally 
- Some arboreal and some are not (such as Baboons)
- Diurnal

### Small and Great Apes
- No tails
- Specialized shoulder for hanging
- Brachiation
- Some, such as Gorillas, knuckle walk and can stand on two feet for short periods

#### Small and Great Ape Behavior
- **Grooming**
	- cleaning
	- opportunity to show group solidarity 
	- Apes use it as a way to welcome new members into the group and reaffirm group membership
- **Learning and Tool Use**
	- Chimps, orangutans and bonobos make use of tools. Some have even been observed to make or modify tools

## Human Evolution
### The Big Early Finds
#### Raymond Dart find the Taung Baby
- Raymond Dart found the Skull of a Australopithecus africanus within a limestone quarry in South Africa in 1924
	- The Foramen magnum was located at the base of the brain indicating "southern Ape" walked upright
	- Despite the small brain and ape like appearance Dart concluded this was an ancestor to Humans
	- The skull was of a child from 3-4 years of age

#### Donald Johanson finds "Lucy"
- In 1974, he located fossils dubbed Lucy in Norther Ethiopia
- Lucy is the first known Australopithecus afarensis
	- slightly older than africanus

#### Laetoli Foot Prints
- 59 foot prints found preserved in the ash
- The foot prints were made by two A. afarensis and were dated to around 3.5 million years ago 

### Traits of species in chronological order
#### General traits of A. afarensis
- Age - 3.9-2.9 million years ago
- Brain size- 380-430 cc's (modern humans are 1350-1430)
- Walked on two feet
- found only in Africa
- likely lived on the savannah
- Gracile

#### General Traits of A. africanus
- Age 3-2.3 million years ago
- Brain Size around 440 cc
- Found only in Africa
- Gracile (meaning its small)

#### General traits of A./P. boisei
- off shoot 
	- not related to modern humans
- Sometimes called Austraopthecus boisei or Paranthropis boisei
- Sagittal Crest for jaw muscle attachment. This is for chewing hard plants
	- Large Mastoids also for chewing
- Age: 2.3 - 1.2 million years ago
- Brain size: 400-500 cc's (they for a lot bigger, their brains did not)

## Why walk on two legs
- Can see further, be seen
- Can now reach higher and access to more hands
- less surface area exposed to the sun
	- catch more wind
	- dissipate heat faster
- increased endurance
- greater finger dexterity
	- at the cost of hand durability
- made childbirth more difficult
