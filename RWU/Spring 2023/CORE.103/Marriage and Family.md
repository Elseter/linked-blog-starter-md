# Marriage and Family
---
## Marriage
- one of the very few cultural universal
	- every culture in the world has some concept of marriage
	- While it is probably the most common cultural phenomena, I would estimate that it may also be the most variable

- Marriage is defined anthropologically as a culturally sanctioned union between two or more people that establishes certain rights and obligations between the people, between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws
	- such marriage rights and obligations most often include, but are not limited to sex, labor, property, child rearing, exchange, and status

### The Key parts of marriage are defined by your culture
1. How many males can be in the marriage
2. How many females can be in a marriage
3. How many non-binary individuals can be in a marriage
4. How related can they be
5. Who can you marry
6. Does one side or both have to pay
7. Where do you live afterwards

#### Who can you marry
- Some groups require
	- Endogamy - marriage within a group
		- In other words you are required to marry within cultural group
	- Exogamy - You must marry outside your cultural group

- Which do we have?
	- Can you think of cases for the other in your culture?

##### Endogamous Examples
- Certain religions
- Castes within a caste system (India)

##### Exogamy Examples
- Cannot marry your cousin here
- Often in clan systems you must marry outside your clan or moiety (more about this in kinship lecture)

#### How many people can you marry
- Monogamy
- Polygamy
	- Polygyny - many wives (sometimes sisters)
	- Polyandry - one woman to many men (nearly always brothers)

- Serial Polygamy-technically what most people in the United States have - Marry and divorcing

##### Monogamy
- One person to another person
- In our society we get to choose (though our family attempts to and often does have quite a bit of input)

###### Arranged Marriages
- Though not common in North America, sometimes a marriage partner is chosen at birth or later in life
- Often the preferred marriage partner is a parallel cousin. A parallel cousin is the child of his father's brother or mother's sister

##### Polygyny
- This is multiple women married to the same man. This does not mean that every man has multiple wives but every man is allowed to have multiple wives
- Often only rich men would have multiple wives 
	- 85% of the world societies (not by population) have this type of marriage
	- Examples: Islamic, Mormons, many hunter-gatherer societies

##### Polyandry
- This is one woman married to many men (often brothers). This is really rare. This only occurs among the Inuit, Marquesan Islanders of Polynesia and Tibetans in Central Asia
- Fewer than a dozen societies total do this

###### Polyandry in Tibet
- In Tibet there is very little farm land because they live very high in the mountains
- Land is inherited by males
- In this society one set of brother married one woman. Usually only the eldest males (actually mates with the woman)
- Done to preserve farmland

#### Where do you live after you get married
- There are three types of post marriage living arrangements
	- Matrilocal - lives with mother's family
	- Patrilocal - Lives with father's family
	- Amibilocal - The couple may choose which family to live with
	- Neolocal - Lives in a new residence with neither family

#### Paying for Marriage
- This is actually really common and happened in Westernized societies in the past (but no longer)
- There are several different types of payment
	1. Bridewealth
	2. Bride Service
	3. Dowry

##### Bridewealth
- Money or valuable goods paid by the groom or his family to the bride's family upon marriage; also called bride-price

##### Bride Service
- This is when the groom must work with the bride's family. This is not just for a couple says, this is often for several years

##### Dowry
- This was practiced by western cultures in the past. 
- This is when a payment is required to either the husband or the husbands family
- This is often the woman's inheritance from her family

### One of the most different marriage practices
- Marriage among the Nayar of Northeastern India is one of the most unlike ours, and therefore should be discussed
- The first ceremony that occurs is the Tali tying ceremony. During this ceremony several girls aged 6 months to 12-14 years are wedded to different men
- If they are old enough sometimes the marriage is consummated (though most times it is not)

### Tali Tying
- The women can then have sex with other men who will father their children
- The visiting of these husbands are known as sanbandham
	- A woman may have several of these husbands at once
- When the man who was involved in the Tali tying ceremony dies, the woman must dance at his funeral
	- All of her children inherit the man's status and possessions
