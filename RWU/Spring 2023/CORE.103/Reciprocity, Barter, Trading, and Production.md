# Reciprocity, Barter, Trading, and Production

## Gifts
- In 1923 French Anthropologist/Sociologist Marcel Mauss wrote an entire book about the importance of Gifts in society
	- Gifts create debt
	- Dept produces Inequality

### Gifts as Debt
- Marcel Mauss argues that giving a gift is the art of creating a debt
	- He argues that no gift is altruistic and that we always expect to receive something in return , or wish to gather the debt of others to increase our status
- The worse kind of gift to receive is one so valuable it cannot be repaid, because then you are in great debt to the person

### Forms of Reciprocity
- Generalized
- Balanced
- Negative

#### Generalized
- Generalized Reciprocity - The value of values of the objects are not calculated, but an exchange occurs
	- This is like the hunter-gathers sharing meat or a modern party
- This is also the modern idea of "pass it along to the next person" or karma
- The exchange can be one-way (one person giving), two-way (an exchange), or multi-way (a bunch of folks sharing food)
- Usually among family or friends the exception being "pass it along" random kindness

#### Balanced Reciprocity
- The value of the goods is calculated
	- It is an exchange of equal valued goods or services
	- The giving, receiving and timing are all specified 
- Not trading, but hosting baby showers, buying a round of drinks (after everyone else has), giving birthday presents
- The key aspects here are that the exchanges are expected and equal value
	- Usually done among family and friends

#### Negative Reciprocity or Barter
- Parties have opposing interests and are attempting to get the object or service for as little a cost to themselves as possible
- Strategies involved could include manipulations, cheating, or taking by force
- Modern examples include Ebay
- Usually done among strangers not family or friends

### Modes of Production

- "According to Karl Marx (1818 - 1883), the combination of forces and relations of production means that the way people relate to the physical world and the way people related to each other socially are bound up together in specific and necessary ways. People must consume to survive, but to consume they must produce, and in producing they necessarily enter into relations which exist independently of their will"
	- Juhayer Tansim


#### Forces and Relations of Production
- Forces of Production - The materials and labor needed to produce what we need
- Relations of Production  - The relations and social institutions to produce what we need

#### Essentially, Marx argues that upper class can control the lower classes
- Through control of the means and forces of production the upper class has a lot of power
- This can be reinforced through institutions which devalue the work of the lower class or encourages loyalty to ideals or the higher class

#### Capitalist Institution
- Protestant Ethic - Anything earned through hard work is fair and that hard work is the norm. Essentially a religious backing to encourage work in the secular world
- Capitalism also recognizes and encourages folks to have an unlimited want of resources while recognizing that many items (or resources) are scarce
