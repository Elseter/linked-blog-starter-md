# Kinship and Clan Structure
---
## Descent Groups
- A descent Group is any kin-ordered social group with a membership in the direct line of descent from a real (historical) or fictional common ancestor
- There are many different ways to reckon descent groups

### Types of Descent Groups
- Bilateral-Descent down both lines
- Unilateral-Descent down one line
	- Matrilineal - Descent down the mother's line
	- Patrilineal - Descent down the father's line
	- Ambilineal - Descent down wither the father's or mother's as chosen by Ego

- Lineages are almost always exogamous

#### Bilateral Kinship
- Reckon on both the mother's line and father's line
- This is also known as the Eskimo System (Horribly racist)
- It is what we do
- Typically features neolocal residence
- Examples of societies that live this way are most westernized cultures and the Inuit

#### What effects does a Matrilineal descent have?
- Marriages tend to be weaker, as men have very little say in their wives' households. Wives have to do very little to divorce husbands
- Children's father figure tends to be their mother's brother instead of their genetic father
- Inheritance goes down the female line
- Anything that is done by males in the household is done by the mother's brother, not the father
- Residence is Matrilocal

#### What effects does a patrilineal system have?
- The father usually makes most or all of the decisions for the family
- Any paternal uncles become like second fathers
- Inheritance is down the male line
- Often results in ancestor worship
- Females are often married with dowries within these systems
- Often patrilocal residence

##### Example of Patrilineal Society: Pre Communism Han Chinese
- Family membership was important, but the most important unit of kinship was a person's membership in the tsu. The tsu consists of men who trace their ancestry back through males to a common ancestor
- A woman was absorbed into a man's tsu upon marriage

#### Ambilineal Societies
- In these societies, the immediate or nuclear family tends to be the most important social unit
- An example of this is among the Kwak'waka'wakw. This means that person must choose to live in the long house of his/her mother or father

### Clans
- Clans are extended unilinear descent groups which claim common descent from a distant often mythical ancestor
- Clans don not share a residence, but often meet at certain times of the year to perform rituals and reaffirm their relationship
- Clans are common at the tribe political level
- Clan members may not even know each other but often wear some kind of iconography allowing them to recognize each other

#### Totemism
- Totemism is a special form of Clan structure in which the clan claims to be related to some particular plant or animal, or objects
- Examples of often used clan titles are Raven, Wolf, Bear, or Turtle (usually something regarded as fierce, wise, or clever). 

### Phratries
- A phratry is a unilineal descent group composed of at least two clans that supposedly share a common ancestry, whether or not they really do
- Essentially a phratry is just a group of clans that feel they are related
- Phratries are exogamous

### Moieties
- A moiety is when a society is split into two groups based on descent (there are often two groups of clans)
- Moieties are exogamous, but the catch is, not only can you not marry someone from your moiety, you must marry someone from the moiety you are not in
