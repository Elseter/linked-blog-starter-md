# Race, Racism, and Modern Human Variation
---
## Lecture Style
- This lecture is going to be a bit different than usual, as it will incorporate several activities and will be structured somewhat more like an argument
- Special Note: this is a touchy subject try to be extremely understanding during this lecture. name calling, stereotyping is not the goal of this lecture. 

### Quick Side Note about Typologies
- Typologies are a way to divide up data and put them into categories
- Typically typologies are built to help a scientist answer a question, but we use typologies in our day to day life as well
- The overall goal, however, is to take a lot of variability at summarize it

### 5 Social Science Races
- In this section, everyone in the class was asked to name what they thought the 5 races recognized by social sciences
	- **My Guesses:**
		- Caucasian 
		- African
		- Latino
		- Asian
		- Middle Eastern

- There are NOT 5 Socially Science races. This was a lie to draw attention to the fact that race is not easily defined and it does not make a good topology

## Skin Color
- Skin color is one of the major ways that people state they can tell races apart
	- The color of your skin has to do with the geographic area that your ancestors come from
	- People with darker skin are less prone to have skin cancer and do not get sun burned as easily

	- It is thought that those living in less sunny environments (traditionally) have lighter skin in order to process as much vitamin D as possible

## History of Racism
- Blumenbach 1752-1840
	- On the Natural Variety of Mankind
		- Blumenbach judged a woman's skull who was from the Caucus mountains to be the most beautiful
		- Come up with the Racial titles of Caucasian, American Indians, Mongolian, Malay, and Ethiopian
- He was a complete quack and used scientific pseudoscience

## Ota Benga
- Ota was captured while living in the Congo
- Ota came into the possession of some North American businessmen in 1904
- He was exhibited at the World's Fair in 1904 in Saint Louis
- He went back to the Congo in 1906 to help collect artifacts for the museum of natural history
- Lived in the Bronx zoo from 1906-1916 as an exhibit
- He was turned over to an orphanage in 1916 at age 35. He shot himself when he learned he would never return home

## Anthropologists Contribute to Racism
- Morton gathered as many skulls from as many "races" as possible. To measure the volume he stuffed/poured mustard seed and lead shot into the skull
	- Found that the Caucasian people had the greatest volume
- Stephen Jay Gould re-did the experiment and found that he (Morton) had faked the data

## The IQ test issue
- Army recruits were given tests in the 1950's as they entered the military
- Overall, within these tests African Americans did not perform as well as "white soldiers"
- It should be noted, however, that Northern African Americans outperformed Southern Whites

### The Black Intelligence Test of Cultural Homogeneity
- This test demonstrates the ethnicity and cultural background have more to do with how you perform on IQ tests than does intelligence
- This test was written using analogies better understood by the African American community
- Within this test African American out score Caucasian people, though it tests logic, memory and other subjects the same way an IQ tests does
