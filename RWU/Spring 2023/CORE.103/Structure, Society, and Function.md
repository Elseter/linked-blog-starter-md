# Structure, Society, and Function
---
## An Ethnocentric View
- Early anthropologists (and many members of the Western World) thought that order and complex economic systems were only found in "civilized" societies
- It was thought that other "primitive" societies were less complex and therefore less rational or logical

### Malinowski creates Functionalism
- Malinowski created a theoretical approach known as functionalism
	- This is the concept that all societies, "civilized" or not, had concepts of economics, law and social norms
- He considered "primitive" cultures to be logical
	- He thought they contained institutions and societal norms which served the same function as those within "civilized" societies

#### A few definitions
- **Institutions**:
	- Like social norms, but bigger
	- Patterns of living that are enduring and help to facilitate the goals of a society
		- In regular conversation the word institution is used more like the work institute which refers to a place or organization 

##### Examples of Institutions 
- Examples of Institutions within the culture of the United States include -
	- The Church
	- Football
	- The education system
	- Capitalism
	- and sadly, institutionalized racism 

### Institutions and Functions
- Institutions within a culture have two types of functions
	- Manifest - the intended function
	- Latent - Unintended functions

#### Example of a "primitive" Institution
- Food sharing among Gatherer-Hunter groups
- Gatherer-Hunters share food amongst themselves
	- Often the pieces of meat that certain people get is defined by their relationship with kin
- Food sharing can be very complicated in that a person could have to give the left leg of a beast to his/her mother-in-law the right flank to her/his brother and so forth

##### What are some of the functions
- Why share?
	- Promote survival among the group 
	- With the hopes that someone will share with you in the future 
		- have others be indebted to you
	- Decrease risk by sharing food and increase social cohesion

### A "Western" Institution
- Higher education is a western institution
- Manifest - 
	- Promote education and provide access to resources
	- Make money
- Latent - 
	- the student debt loan crisis
	- The increased class divide 


#### Total Institution 
- Total institutions are those where your complete environment is controlled 
- Examples of total institutions include the military, prison, boarding schools and cults

#### Complexity
- Often anthropologists like to define institutions in terms of their complexity
	- Complexity can be though of in terms of both the number of moving parts within a culture or institution and organization of these parts
	- Complex cultures would have many concepts and many complex relationships between those concepts
	- many hunter-gatherer groups have complex relationships 

## Political Power and Government
### A Few Terms
**Political Organization:**
- In anthropological terms is defined as the way power is accumulated, arranged, executed, and structurally embedded in a society
- This can vary in scale from the organization of a whale hunt to the modern war efforts
**Power:**
- Power is the ability of one person or group to impose their will on others to make them do things

**Un-centralized Authority:**
- Leaders in this type of government do not have the power to force people to do anything and instead of control through coercion
- Decisions are often made by a collective of adult
**Centralized Authority:**
- One group of people is in control, usually at the other's expense
- Either a chief or the state holds the power

#### Power To and Power Over
- Power to is simply what rights and abilities a person has within a government
- Power over is when the government or a person within it has complete power over one or many members of the society 

#### Levels of Political Power
- Anthropology has classically defined four levels of political organization
	1. Bands
	2. Tribes
	3. Chiefdoms
	4. States

##### Bands
- We have already talked about this
- Authority is uncentralized
- **Size** - Typically less than 25 people
- **Social Structure** - Usually made up of a person's extended family and therefore consists of 1-5 immediate families
- Typically found among Hunter-Gatherers 
- **Ranking** - Achieved
- **Interactions with other polities** - They interact with other bands by exchanging marriage partners (nearly required) and engaging in trade. Usually a person will have family in other bands. Bands may depend on each other for mutual aid when time is bad
- Typically are "Egalitarian" with big men and women
- EX.
	- An example of a band can be found among the Inuit. The harsh climate in Northern Canada demands that they were/are hunter gatherers and live/lived in small equalitarian groups

##### Tribes
- Tribes are sometimes organized out of several bands, and other times made up of settles groups of people.
- Usually tribes consists of several local communities such as clans, bands, or other kinship groups
- **Authority** - Un-centralized
- **Size** - Over 100 people
- **Ranking** - Achieved
- **Social Structure** - Usually made of several groups, such as bands, or clans, that are related either through blood or fictive means
	- Fictive means include a relationship to a fictive clan totem, such as the raven or bear clan
- May only meet at certain times during the year to exchange marriage partners, do rituals, trade etc.

###### The people of Poverty Point
- Though we do not know for sure, as it is an archaeological example, it appears that the people who came to Poverty Point were likely a tribe
- They were several bands of hunter gatherers who came to poverty point at various times during the year to exchange goods and preform rituals

##### Chiefdoms
- a Chiefdom is where two or more groups and/or villages are organized under a single ruling individual
- **Authority** - Centralized (The chief)
- **Size** - 1,000 or more people
- Usually only occurs among people who produce food
	- Food and prestige goods are redistributed by the chief
- Ranking is no longer achieved. Instead, ascribed status determines who is chief
- The elite have a monopoly on prestige goods
- Specialization is sometimes present in the more complex chiefdoms through the specialists are often only sponsored

###### Prestige Goods
- Prestige goods are those well made items which can be used to metaphorically symbolize power
- Ex
	- Apple Products
	- Home Ownership

###### Example of a Chiefdom Cahokia
- Power at Cahokia
- Religious site in what is now modern day Illinois
- Based on control of Exotic Resources
	- "Wealth Finance"
		- Linked to long-distance trade networks
		- Raw materials
			- Sheet Copper, Mica

##### State Societies
- State level societies are those like ours
- The centralized authority may come in the form of a King or Queen, Senate, Emperor or Empress, President, or Dictator
- **Authority** - Senate, President, Dictator, or some such
- **Size** - Over 10,000
- Established laws and the Government has a monopoly on force
	- Force becomes the exclusive power of the state and law enforcement is codified
- Redistribution of goods occurs through Taxes
- States can encompass several ethnic groups (cultures) as well as incorporate smaller governments
- Defined territory (lines on a map)

#### Forms of Social Control
- There are several methods of social control
	- **Sanctions** - An externalized social control designed to encourage conformity to social norms
	- **Witchcraft** 
	- **Law**

##### Witchcraft
- Witchcraft is often used in societies without centralized authority (Bands and Tribes) to keep social peace
- People blame common place ill luck, disease, and other bad fortune on magic
- Thus, the threat of retaliation via the medium of black magic keeps any ill behaviors from occurring
- Witchcraft can also be used by the official who comes and acts as a judge or confessor

##### Law
- Laws are what we are familiar with
- The anthropological definition - Formal rules of conduct, when violated, effectuate negative sanctions
- The key difference is there are written rules which we have to abide by
- There are set punishments for each law that could be broken
- We have more laws in the United States than in any other country
- The laws of many other state societies are less specific such as "do not be rude in public"
