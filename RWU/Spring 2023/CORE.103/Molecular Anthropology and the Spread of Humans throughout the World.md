## Several Types of DNA
- Nuclear DNA (nDNA) - found within the Nucleus of the cell and codes for the majority of your phenotype
	- Transmitted sexually from both parents
- Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
	- found within mitochondria and passed on materially

### mtDNA
- typically, why is mtDNA favored for ancient DNA studies
	1. It is affected less by natural selection than nDNA
	2. Portions of it are hypervariable
		- Change quickly and often
		- need changes so we can track those changes through space and time
	3. There are more copies than nDNA
	4. Only comes from the mother

### The first mtDNA studies
- The first studies of mtDNA were done on Native Americans
	- This is why the Native American haplogroups are labeled A,B,C, and D 
	- and X
- In the earliest studies X was simply listed as other
- It was later decided that those Native Americans marked other were actually haplogroups X, which is commonly found in Europe

### Polymerase Chain Reaction
- By using primers PCR targets certain piece of DNA. These small pieces are then cloned several times such that a very small and infrequent piece of DNA can be studied
- Ancient strands of DNA are often not very long and amid much contamination. Therefore PCR was an essential step to improving ancient DNA studies

### mtDNA types and groups
- A Haplogroup is a large subset of related mtDNA types
	- labeled with letters such as A,B, or L
- Haplotypes are more specific and list both the haplogroup and the location of any mutations
- A random example of a haplotype is A1-M31 P82

- Using these specific haplogroups, we can attempt to map the movements of ancient peoples

### Molecular Clocks
- the estimate of how old a sample is has to do with how long you think that it would take the mutations found in modern samples to develop
- develop an expected rate of mutation
- These age estimates can vary greatly based on what mutation rates you use

### Two ways to calibrate the molecular clock
