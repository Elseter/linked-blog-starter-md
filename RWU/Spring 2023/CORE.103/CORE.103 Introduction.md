# CORE.103 Introduction

## Goals of the Course
1. Learn about the social science
2. Gain a Cultural Relativistic Perspective
3. Gain an understanding of Social Inequalities (Profs Theme)

## What are the Social Sciences
- Social Sciences are those that study human behavior and society 
	- Sometimes referred to as the social sciences
	- These Include
		- **Anthropology**
		- **Psychology**
		- **Sociology**
		- And many more

>[! def] What is Psychology
>According to the APA, “Psychologists study the mind and behavior, and their biological foundations.”
>- There are a lot of different sub-fields of psychology examples include developmental and evolutionary.
---
>[! def] What is Sociology
>The study of social interactions and society
>- Subfields include: sociology of religion, military sociology, and many more
---
>[! def] What is Anthropology
>The study of human culture and behavior. There are 4 subfields, all study culture
>1. Cultural
>2. Evolutionary/Biological
>3. Linguistic
>4. Archaeology

### Cultural Anthropology
- The study of the culture of modern peoples
- Can include modern hunter-gatherers
- Can include the study of smaller sub cultures such as 
	1. Breast cancer survivors
	2. Drug users in New York City
	3. People who play massive multiplayer games online
- Often studying these cultures in the field, which may be dangerous

### Evolutionary/Biological Anthropology
- This subfield is difficult to define, but includes those anthropologists who study of the biology of humans or do cultural anthropology with an evolutionary theoretical perspective
- Examples include
	- Study of Human health worldwide
	- Study of Mother-child interaction
	- Study of modern Apes (non-human)
	- Study of modern human genetics (or genetic material from past peoples)

### Linguists
- The study of human language
- These anthropologists study how languages have changed in both modern cultures and cultures of the past

### Archaeology
- The study of the past through the use of material remains 
- Archaeologists study
	- Ancient stone tools
	- Ancient Pottery
	- Pollen grain from plants ancient people ate/used
	- Bones of animals left behind by people
	- Modern Garbage (this is rare but some archeologists do it

### Examples of Collaboration within the Social Sciences
- Ethnoarchaeology (cultural) - study present cultures to gain insight about past cultures
- Evolutionary/Biological - genetic work to determine when the people who would become native Americans entered what is referred to as the new world
- Linguistic - determining the divergence times of languages to determine when people entered the new world

## Culture
>[! quote] Edward Tylor, 1871 - What is Culture?
>"Knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society" 
- This definition does not include language, music, signs and religion
- He essential was listing things people do, but animals appear not to do
- culture in this sense, is learned from other people
>[! tip] The 3rd aspect of culture
>**kulturebrille - culture glasses**
>Your culture determines how you see the world, and also has the potential to blind you to the ways others from other cultures may experience the world

### Specifically Cultural Anthropology
- Cultural anthropologists produce studies known as Ethnography (Ethnographies plural)
- The key to most ethnographies is field work. 

# What is Psychology
## Different Approaches to Psychology
>[! def] Psychology
>The scientific study of our thoughts, feelings and behaviors
>- An approach or perspective in psychology is a particular view as to why, and how, it is we think feel and behave as we do

### Behavioral
- Behavioral Psychology is basically interested in how our behavior results from the stimuli both in the environment and within ourselves

### Biological
- The biological approach believes us to be a consequence of our genetics and physiology. 
- It is the only approach in psychology that examines thought, feelings, and behaviors from a physical point of view

### Evolutionary
- Evolutionary psychology focus on how evolution has shaped the mind and behavior

### Developmental
- Developmental psychology, also known as Human Development, is the scientific study of progressive psychological changes that occur in human beings as they age

### Psychodynamic
- Sigmund Freud was the founder of the psychodynamic approach to psychology 
- This is the school of thought that emphasized the influence of the unconscious mind on behavior

>[! tip] Key Concept
>Psychology is
>- why we do what we do
>- why we feel the way we feel
>- why we think as we think

# Sociology
## Defining the Sociological Perspective
>[! def] Sociology
>Sociology is the scientific study of human society and social interactions

### Sociology and Common Sense
- Common sense assumptions are usually based on very limited observation
- Moreover, the premises on which common sense assumptions are seldom examined
- Sociology seeks to:
	- Use a broad range of carefully selected observations
	- and theoretically understand and explain those observations
- Might confirm common sense observations, its broader base and theoretical rational provide a stronger basis for conclusions

### The Development of Sociology
- emerged as a separate discipline in the nineteenth century
- This was a time of great social upheaval due largely to the French and Industrial Revolutions 
- Several early sociologists shaped the direction of the discipline
