# Gender
---
## How many Genders are there?
- class discussion
	- How many genders are there?
	- What are they?

## Gender and Sex
- We often conflate the two in common conversation but the two terms mean two different things
	- Gender is cultural
	- Sex is biological

### Sex
- Sex is the biological traits that a person has
	- This is genetically determined by the sex chromosomes
		- Women have 2 XXs
		- Men have an X and a Y
		- It should be noted that is really not this simple. There are various combinations resulting in more than two sexes

#### Primary and Secondary Differences
- This refers to the differences between sexes beside the obvious differences of genitals (Primary characteristics) and secondary characteristics
	- Secondary sexual characteristics include
		- Hair Growth
		- Breasts
		- Voice

#### Sexual Dimorphism
- Humans exhibit sexual dimorphism, which are pronounced differences between the sexes that are not the primary or secondary differences from the last slide
	- These traits that vary include differences in 
		- Height
		- Weight
		- Longevity

- Some primates have more sexual dimorphism than us while other primates have less
- Bonobos have less
- While Gorillas have more

#### Sexual Dimorphism in Humans
- Weight
	- Men:  191 lbs
	- Women:  164 lbs
- Height
	- Men:  5'10.2"
	- Women:  5'4.5"

- Note these stats are modern and from the U.S and are much bigger than the rest of the world

### Gender
- Gender - cultural assigned behaviors/culturally expressed/self identified (often highly correlated with sex)
- The behaviors expect from one gender can vary highly from one culture to the next. In other words what is manly or womanly in one culture may not be in another
- In addition to men and women there are those individuals who are non-binary
	- Some societies may only recognize two genders, but in truth non-binary individuals have been around for quite a while and across many cultures

#### Gender Roles
- Gender roles are the expected tasks and activities that a given gender should do or engage in
- Discuss the gender roles in the past of our society
	- Are there gender roles in our culture now?
- We had many gender roles in the 1950s what were they?
	- Are there still gender roles in our modern culture

#### Gender Stratification
- Unequal distribution of rewards (socially valued resources, power, prestige, human rights and personal freedoms) between men and women, reflecting their different positions in the social hierarchy
- Do we still have this?

##### Gender Stratification in the US
- as of the 2009 tax returns women make on average 77% of what men make. 
	- If you average out education, this jumps to 81%
- In a society so driven by the economy this is a pretty good proxy measure for power prestige
- This is obviously something we still need to work on as a country

##### Gender Roles and Stratification throughout the World
- All of these are taken from a paper by M.F Whyet who surveyed many cultures to compile these statistics
	- What these represent are the percentages of societies who practice a particular social norm
	- We will talk about each
- Data is only available for men and women at this time
	- Thus, non-binary individuals are not represented in these statistics. Hopefully this will be fixed in the future

#### Time and effort spent on subsistence
- More by men - 16%
- Roughly Equal - 61%
- More by Women - 23%

#### Gender Roles an their effects across the world
- Who does the domestic work?
	- Males do none - 51%
	- Males do some, but it is mostly done by females - 49%

- Who has final say in the care of an infant (under 4 years old)
	- Males have more say - 16%
	- Roughly equal - 16%
	- Females have more say - 66%

- Does the society allow more multiple spouses?
	- Only for males - 77%
	- For both but more commonly males - 4%
	- For neither - 16%
	- For both but more commonly females - 2%

- Is there a double standard about pre-marital sex?
	- Yes females are more restricted - 44%
	- No, they are equally restricted - 56%

- Is there a double standard about Extramarital sex?
	- Yes, females are more restricted - 43%
	- Equal restrictions - 55%
	- Males are more restricted - 3%

#### Gender among Foragers
- When men provide more calories in the diet gender stratification is more severe
- When gathering is more prominent gender stratification is less severe
- When public and domestic sphere are closely integrated gender stratification is less severe

#### Gender Roles among Horticulturists
- Gender roles and stratification varies mostly based on how you track your kinship
- In Matrilineal, or Matrilocal societies gender stratification is reduced

#### Gender among Agriculturists
- When horticulture moves up toward agriculture men tend to take over the farming and the gender stratification becomes worse for women
	- The stratification becomes more severe with plow agriculture as typically men use plows
- Domestic and public sphere are also apart in many of these groups

### Two-Spirited People
- This is a third gender among the Plains Native Americans
	- This was noted in the ethnographic present i.e. upon contact and was likely present in the archaeological past as well
- Essentially this is man who takes on the roles of a woman
- Has become a Pan-Indigenous word for people who identify as having both a masculine and feminine spirit 
- Though it originates among a few Native American groups of the Great Plains it has been adopted by many other Native Groups in its current usage

#### Myth of the Two Spirited People
- ¨At one time ... a band of Winnebago returned from a war expedition with several Sioux [Šąhą] captives, among them a chief. Under ordinary circumstances the Warrior (Hawk) Clan would have taken charge of the ultimate fate of the prisoners, but in this village the only members of the Warrior Clan were a very small boy and his grandmother. The grandmother was called upon to speak for the grandson because, while the decision should have rested with the male members of the clan, the only male member present was a child. What became of the chief's followers is not known, but the grandmother decreed that the leader was to remain in the village unharmed, but had to dress, act, work and generally conduct himself as a woman as long as he lived.“

## Conclusions
- There are certainly still Gender roles in our culture today although we are moving toward erasing them for our culture. Will we actually ever achieve this?
- Gender roles determine much of our culture and do much to structure many peoples lives.
- Gender includes more than just men and women. Several non-binary genders have been/are recognized throughout history and across various cultures.
