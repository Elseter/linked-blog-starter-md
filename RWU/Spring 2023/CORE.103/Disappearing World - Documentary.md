	- by giving he earns fame and status for his tribe
	- The size of the given gift determines how much fame and status you gain for giving it
- Big men, such as Onka have no power over their tribes men/women
	- He can not order them to do anything
	- He can only persuade, convince, and beg
- no main town, just scattered settlements

- definitely seems like there is a great deal of inequality between the opportunities available to men vs women
