# Language
---
## What is Language
- Primary means of human communication, spoken and written
- Book Definition -is a system of symbolic communication using sound and/or gestures that are put together according to rules resulting in meanings that are based on agreement bye a society and intelligible to all who speak it
- System for communication using sounds or gestures put together in meaningful ways according to set rules
- Through language, people can transmit their culture from one generation to the next text
	- Always changing
		- Dead languages
		- Evolved Languages
		- E.g Old English vs Modern English
		- Dialects

### Evolved Language Examples
- Old english is barely even recognizable as english

## Linguists
- Study of all aspects of language
- There are approximately 6,500 languages worldwide todays
- Have found that all languages are organized in the same basic manner 

## Origins
- Spoken language = Unknown, between 50K - 400KYA
- Written language = 6000 YA
- Communication = Millions of years ago

## Benefits
- Convey information
- Teach and learn
- Share
	- Ideas
	- Concepts
	- Ideology
	- Experiences
- Coordinate activities

## Nonhuman Communication
- Call systems
	- vocal systems with limited number of sounds
	- less flexible
	- Cannot be combined to signal more than one thing

## Homo spp. Adaptation
- FOXP2 Gene
- Allows fine tongue and lip movements
- Mutation in humans ~150 KYA
- Selective advantages
	- Information storage
	- Communication
	- Anticipate responses
- A major enabling factor of language in humans is the structure of the larynx
- Lower larynx in humans allows for a wider range of sounds to be produced

## Nonverbal
- Facial expressions
- Stances 
- Gestures
- Body Movement
- Signal can be:
	- Intentional 
	- Unconscious

## Proxemics
- Cross-cultural study of humankind's perception and use of space
	- Intimate (0 - 18 in)
	- personal-casual (1.5 ft - 4 ft)
	- Social - Consultive (4 - 12 ft)
	- Public (12 + ft)
	- These spacial definitions vary from culture to culture
- Interesting Proxemics can occur when two cultures meet

## Types
- Spoken Language
- Sign Language
- Written Language
- Symbolic

## Universal Capacity
- Can learn other languages
	- Bilingual
	- Multilingual
- Structure, concepts, physical morphology, and function same
- Brain processes information same

## Linguistics
- Three Types:
	- Descriptive
		- Building blocks of language and rules
	- Historical
		- Study of language change and relatedness
	- Sociocultural
		- How people use words

### Descriptive Linguistics
- These Linguists focus on 
	- Phonology 
	- Morphology
	- Sytax
	- Grammar
- Understand Rules
	- Often unconscious
- Grammar
	- Rules that describe patterns of usage
	- How sounds are combined to make meaningful speech

#### Phonology
- Phoneme
	- Smallest sound contrast that distinguishes meaning
- Phonemics
	- Study of sound constants (phonemes) in a language
- Phonetics
	- Study of speech sounds - what people actually say

#### Morphology
- Study of words and word construction
- Lexicon : All words in a language and their meaning

#### Syntax
- Arrangement of words in phrases and sentences

#### A descriptive Linguist Must...
1. Isolate phonemes (phonology)
2. Determine all combinations of sounds that have meaning (morphology)
3. See how morphemes put together into phrases and sentences (syntax and grammar)

### Competency
- Mastery of adult grammar and ability 
	- "Fluency"
- Know the rules and proper social contexts for use
- Communicative competence
	- partial ability - can speak and be understood
	- Foreign language

### Historical Linguistics
- Study of language change
- Analogous to archaeology
	- Use modern and written, work back
- Language families
	- Groups of languages with a common origin

#### Romance Languages
- Trace back to Latin - Roman Empire
	- common history

#### Protolanguage
- Precursor prior to split
- Common ancestor language
- Usually extinct
- Indo-European example
	- Proto-IndoEuropean
		- Began ca. 4000 BC
		- Perhaps earlier and associated with Neolithic dispersal of farming populations

#### Glottochronology
- Method for identifying the approximate time that languages branched off from a common ancestor
- Based on analyzing core vocabularies

#### Core Vocabularies
- Pronouns, lower numerals, and names for body parts and natural objects
- Based on the assumption that certain core words change slowly over time and at a constant rate

#### Language Trees
- Analogous to species evolution
- Same processes associated
	- Isolation
	- Mutation
	- Recombination
- Change at relative rate
	- Can "date" split

### Sociocultural Linguistics
- Study how people use speech
- How people speak in different situations
	- Formal speech
	- Informal speech
- When and Why people switch
	- RACE/ETHNICITY
	- CLASS

#### Dialect
- Distinctive variety of speech used by people of a particular region or by a particular group of people 
- Still mutually intelligible
- More numerous dialects = Older area -> nearer to source of original
