	- No calculators or other devices

- Appendix b
- chapiter 2 - 5

### Topics
- Object Oriented Design
- Algorithm Analysis
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked List
- Array Implementations
- Linked List Implementations

#### Objected Oriented Design
- **Abstraction**
	- Hiding details from the user of an object
	- "able to drive a car without knowing how a car works"
- **Encapsulation**
	- safety driven
	- making data private in objects
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Object creation and behavior in Java**
- **Abstract class**
	- placeholder within class hierarchy
	- "player class and computer class"
		- both share a lot of similarities
		- want to share code between classes
		- but parent class doesn't need to be implemented
		- similar behavior, similar implementations
- **Interface**
	- If the implementation varies so much 
	- Has similar behavior with different implementations
- **Generic Type**
- **Exceptions**

#### Algorithm Analysis
- **Algorithm**
- **Algorithm Analysis**
	- Know the order complexity of algorithms
- **Growth function**
	- $t(n) = 3n^2 +5$
- **Big-O (order)**
	- $O(n^2)$
- **Analyzing code**

#### Stack
- **Stack operations**
	- push 
	- pop
	- peek
- **Array implementation**
- **Linked List implementation**
- **Applications**

#### Queue
- **Queue operations**
- **Circular Array Implementation**
- **Linked List implementation**
- **Applications**

#### Linked-List
- Node Class (concept of a separate node class)
- List management (insert, delete)
