## Lab 8 - Sorting Algorithms
- We are provided a .jar file titled `COMSC111Lab8` which, when run, constructs a GUI for the end user.
- This GUI serves 2 major functions, generating lists given a series of parameters, and sorting these lists using one of five options labeled `Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon`
	- The result of the sorting is then provided

- Utilizing these details, we are tasked with determining what sorting algorithms each sort is utilizing

### Determining each Sorting Algorithm
- The known following sorting algorithms were used (none were repeated)

| Sorting Algorithm | Time Complexity |
| ----------------- |:---------------:|
| Bubble Sort       |    O($N^2$)     |
| Merge Sort        |    O($N^2$)     |
