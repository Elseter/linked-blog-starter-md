# COMSC.111 - Java Review
---
## Pseudocode
- This resembles code, but is more readable and not based on any specific programming languages
- Any programmer should be able to understand
- A common first step in developing an algorithm (sequences of steps to solve the program)
	- Should be detailed enough to make implementation straightforward
	- Should NOT include language specific words or details
