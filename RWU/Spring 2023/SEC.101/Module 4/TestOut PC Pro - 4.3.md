## Linux Facts
- Linus is a major player in computer networking and plays a vital role on servers. desktops, and even mobile devices

### Linux Development history
- in 1983. Richard Stallman announced GNU (GNU's not UNIX)
	- goal of cooperative development of an operating system
- Linux started in 1991 when Linus Torvalds, began a project that would later become the Linux kernel
	- Linus based his version of Linux on a Unix-like system named MINIX

- Linux version 0.02
	- released in October of 1991
	- Contained:
		- Linux Kernel
		- Three basic utilities
			- A bash shell providing a command line interface
			- An update utility used for flushing the file system buffers
			- A GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) that allowed an individual to compile programs

- Open Source
	- The source code for the Linux operating system was shared as freeware on the internet
	- The collaborative development project continued for several years until 1994, when Linux 1.0 was released
>[! tip]
>The Linux kernel is licensed under the GNU general public license (GPL), which requires the source code to remain freely available.

### Linux Expansion and Growth
- Linux can now preform almost any networking role that a competing server operating system can preform, including:
	- File server
	- Print server
	- Database server
	- Web server
	- Email server

 Linux is also becoming popular as  desktop operating system due to its many applications
 - LibreOffice
	 - A free office software suite for word processing, spreadsheets and presentations
- GIMP
	- GNU Image Manipulation Program
	- free and open source image editor similar to photoshop
- LightWorks
	- An editing tool available in free and for-purchase options

### Linux Operating System Overview

**Application platform**
- The operating system provides a platform that applications can run on.
**Hardware Interface**
- A key function of the operating system is to ensure that an application running on the system does not try to use an area in memory that's already in use by another application
- The OS is also responsible for ensuring that an application running on the system does not monopolize the CPU
**Data Storage**
- The operating system is responsible for providing an efficient means of storing data
**Security**
- The operating system is responsible for providing some degree of security for the data that's stored on its storage devices.
**Network Connectivity**
- The operating system provides connectivity between computer systems over a network connection
- They do this using a variety of network media and interfaces, such as an Ethernet connection between computer systems

### Linux Key Components

**Linux Kernel**
- Core of the operating system
- fulfills the key operating system duties listed in overview above
- provides libraries

**Utilities**
- wide variety of utilities
	- creating files
	- maintain file systems
	- editing text files
	- managing  the applications running
	- installing new application

**User Interfaces**
- provides the user interface for the end user to interact with
- two options
	- <u>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</u>
		- click through buttons and navigate windows
	- <u>Text based command line interface (terminal)</u>

### Linux Distributions
- also known as distros
- unique compilation of Linux kernel, utilities, desktop environments, applications

MOST POPULAR:
- Mint
- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Fedora
- SUSE/openSUSE
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Oracle
- CentOS
