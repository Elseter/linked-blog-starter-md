## 8.6.2 Backup Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:
-   Data types  
-   Backup methods  
-   Backup frequency
-   Windows Backup and Restore
-   Windows File History
-   Backup considerations

A _backup_ is an archived copy of data you can use to restore corrupt or lost data in the event of a hardware or system failure. You must perform backups while the system is in good working order. In other words, you must plan for disasters and take the necessary actions to protect systems before there is a problem.

### Data Types
Backup tools can be used to protect different types of data:

- System state data includes all the files required to boot and run the computer. System state data includes the operating system files, the registry, drivers, and configuration files.
- User data includes all data files modified and saved by users (or applications that users run). User data is critical data for a company. Because user data changes constantly, back up the user data frequently and regularly.
- Application data includes files installed by an application and application configuration files. Application data changes following the installation of an application or following a configuration change. Depending on the system you are using, a backup of system state data might include application file backup.
- Image backup data includes everything on a system's hard drive, including the operating system files, applications, and user data.

### Backup Methods
The following table describes backup methods.
#### Full
A full backup:
-   Backs up all files–even those that have not changed since the previous backup.
-   Takes longer to complete than an incremental backup.
-   Is faster to restore than an incremental backup.
-   Is usually run weekly.
#### Incremental
An incremental backup:
-   Backs up every file that's changed since the last full or incremental backup.
-   Completes faster than a full backup.
-   Can be completed daily.
-   Takes longer to restore than a full backup because you must restore the full backup, and then restore each incremental backup in the order it was created.
#### Differential
A differential backup:
-   Backs up every file that's changed since the last full backup.
-   Takes longer to complete than an incremental backup.
-   Is faster to recover than an incremental backup because there are only two files to restore (the full and the differential).
-   Requires more space and bandwidth than an incremental backup.
#### Synthetic
A synthetic backup:
-   Merges the benefits of a full backup with the benefits of an incremental backup.
-   Compares the data found in the last full backup with the current content and uploads only the changes.
-   Takes less time and fewer resources than a full backup.
-   Should not be used in place of regular full backups.

### Backup Frequency
Perform backups according to a well-organized method using a consistent, rotation scheme. Here are a few common rotation types:
#### Grandfather-father-son
The grandfather-father-son backup rotation scheme works like this:
-   The grandfather is a full backup completed once a month and stored offsite.
-   The father is a full backup completed once a week and stored onsite.
-   The son is an incremental backup completed daily and stored on site.
#### 3-2-1 backup rule
The 3-2-1 backup rule involves maintaining three copies of the data. Two copies are kept onsite on two different types of devices. The third copy is kept offsite.
#### First in first out (FIFO)
The first in first out rule works by keeping data for a specific period and then saving over the oldest data once the time has elapsed. For example, if you save files for only 30 days, the 31st day's data is stored over the first day's data.

### Windows Backup and Restore
Windows 11 includes the Backup and Restore feature from Windows 7. Backup and Restore (Windows 7) was available in Windows 8, removed in Windows 8.1, but returned in Windows 10. The Backup and Restore (Windows 7) tool allows you to restore any old Windows 7 backups onto a Windows 10 computer. The tool can also back up a Windows 10 or 11 PC in same way you back up a Windows 7 PC.

This Backup and Restore (Windows 7) process is accessed as follows:

1.  Connect to the device that has the backup files stored on it.
2.  Select **Search**.
3.  Type 'control panel'.
4.  Select **Control Panel**.
5.  Under **System and Security**, select **Backup and Restore (Windows 7)**.

From here, you can perform the following tasks:
#### Setup backup files
A file backup backs up specific files and folders to a compressed file. File backups do not include system files, program files, encrypted files, files in the Recycle Bin, user profile settings, or temporary files. To set up a new Windows backup:
1.  Connect an external device to back up the files to.
2.  Select **Set up backup**. Follow backup instructions.

You can save backups to several different types of storage media:
-   Secondary internal hard drives.
-   External hard drives.
-   Optical drives.
-   USB flash drives.
-   Network shares.

You can't save backup files to:
-   The same disk that is being backed up.
-   A disk containing the Windows operating system.
-   A tape drive.
#### Create a system image
A system image backs up the drives required for Windows to run. If a computer crashes due to corrupt files, you can use the system image to restore the computer to the backup point when everything was working correctly.  
To create a system image:
1.  Select **Create a system image**.
2.  Select the location to save the backup to.
3.  Follow backup instructions.
>[! bug] Recovery Disk
>If you're unable to boot Windows, you will be unable to restore a system image. You can, however, use a recovery disc to restore the operating system so you can then restore the system image.
#### Restore a backup
To restore files from an existing backup:
1.  Select the backup to restore files from.
2.  Select the device that has the backup files stored on it.
3.  Follow file restore instructions.

### Windows File History
File History does not back up the entire system.
-   Only the data in a user's profile is backed up.
-   A user can add folders to a library to back them up using File History.
-   File History backs up files in the background.
-   Once every hour, File History creates a shadow copy of user account files. This creates a snapshot of user account's files at a particular point in time.
-   After creating the shadow copy, Windows keeps track of the prior versions of those files.
-   Users can browse and restore previous versions of files backed up by File History.

File History is disabled by default.
-   When enabling File History, you must specify the location for storing the backup.
-   You must use a drive other than the drive the user files are already on.
-   At least two drives must be implemented for the system to use File History.
-   A best practice is to use a second internal hard disk drive. However, you can also use external flash drives or hard disks.
-   When using an external drive, disable File History before disconnecting the external drive.

When you enable File History, Windows monitors users' libraries, desktop, contacts, and Internet Explorer favorites.
-   By default, File History checks once an hour to see if any data has changed since the last check.
-   File History saves copies of the changed files to the configured location.
-   Once File History is set up, a previous version of a file can be restored if a file gets lost or corrupted.

A profile backup includes all the information stored in the user's library folders:
-   User data files, such as documents, music, and videos.
-   User preferences, such as the desktop background, screensaver, color schemes, contacts, browser favorites, etc.
-   User account details, such as the username, password, etc.

To restore files with File History:
1.  Connect to the device that contains the backup files.
2.  Select **Search**.
3.  Type 'control panel'.
4.  Select **Control Panel**.
5.  Type 'file history' in Control Panel search.
6.  Select **Save backup copies of your files with File History**.
7.  Follow the file restoration instructions.

### Backup Considerations
Keep the following facts in mind when configuring backups:
-   Back up user data more often than system state data (it changes more frequently).
-   Backup system state data and applications (or make a restore point) before you make a system change. During a system state backup, all system configuration information is backed up. You can't selectively back up portions of system data.
-   Be sure to test the backup and restore strategy. Back up data is worthless if you can't restore it.
-   Store backup media offsite to prevent the same disaster from affecting the network and the backup media. You can automatically store backups offsite using network storage devices at another facility or cloud-based services.
-   Use the backup utility to schedule backups, or create a new task in the Scheduled Tasks folder in the Control Panel.
