## 8.3.2 Remote Access Technologies Facts
This lesson will cover:
- Remote Access Methods
- Third-party remote access tools

Remote access allows a host to remotely connect to a computer at a different location using a local area network or the internet.

### Remote Access Methods
#### Remote Desktop
You can use Windows Remote Desktop to access the graphical desktop of other Windows systems over a network connection. Using RDP, you can:
-   See the desktop interface as if you were sitting in front of it.
-   Manipulate files.
-   Run programs.
-   Restart or power down the computer.

For RDP to work, you must:
-   Verify that the system you are connecting to allows remote connections.
-   Know the IP address of the system. If the system is on the local network, you need to know only the name of the system.
-   Enter the credentials of the system administrator account.

Common applications for RDP include:
-   Work from home.
-   Technical support.

RDP security considerations include:
-   Use two-factor authentication.
-   Use a strong password.
-   Keep software up-to-date.
-   Use a firewall to restrict access.
-   Set an account lockout policy.
#### Microsoft Remote Assistance (MSRA)
You can use Microsoft Remote Assistance to turn over control of your system to another remote user.  
  
For MSRA to work the user must:
-   Allow remote assistance.
-   Request assistance.
-   Provide a password to the remote user.
-   Approve the remote connection.

MSRA is commonly used for technical support and troubleshooting purposes.  
  
MSRA security considerations include:
-   Disable remote assistance if it is not in use.
-   Use a strong password.
-   Use two-factor authentication.
-   Keep software up to date.
#### Screen Sharing
Screen sharing is built into the macOS. Using screen sharing, you can:
-   See the desktop interface as if you were sitting in front of it.
-   Manipulate files.
-   Run programs on the remote computer.
-   Restart or power down the computer.

To run screen sharing you need the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) client software which is built into Mac OS X and later versions. Earlier versions require the download of a third-party client software.
#### Secure Shell
Secure Shell (SSH) is used to create a secure Telnet session. Telnet provides a remote connection to a system's command line interface. You can use a SSH connection for:
-   Remote login.
-   File transfer.
-   Running programs.

Telnet is usually used to access servers remotely.  
  
SSH security considerations include:
-   VNC is not secure or encrypted by default.
-   Remote Login must be enabled in System Preferences to ensure that an SSH tunnel is established before using the VNC.

### Third Party Access Tools

-   Technical support.

Most video conferencing software includes support for the following:
-   Audio meetings.
-   Video meetings.
-   Screen-sharing.
-   File sharing.
-   Recording.

Video conferencing security considerations include:
-   Use waiting room features.
-   Use strong passwords.
#### Remote monitoring and management (RMM)
There are many different remote monitoring and management software options on the market. While the specific features vary from one vendor to the next, you can use all RMM software to:
-   Manage devices.
-   Remotely access an organization's devices.
-   Analyze activity and receive automated alerts for unusual activity.
-   Monitor availability.
-   Determine thresholds.

RMM is most used by service providers and IT professionals.

-   Install hardware.
-   Install software.
-   Manage user permissions.
-   Audit device activity.
-   Apply spam filters.
#### File Transfer Software
File transfer software transmits files from one device to another. This can be done over the internet or a local area network. These programs are commonly used to download files from a cloud-based server.  
  
File transfer software security considerations include:
-   Be aware that file-sharing can open the door to malware infection or hacking.
-   Use end-to-end encryption.
-   Use two-factor authentication.
-   Use strong passwords.

## 8.3.5 Remote Desktop Facts
This lesson covers:
- Remote Desktop Client
- Remote Desktop Connection (RDC)
- Remote Desktop Considerations

### Remote Desktop Client
You can access a Windows machine with a Remote Desktop client using a Windows, iOS, macOS, or Android device. You cannot use Remote Desktop Client to connect to a Windows Home machine. You can use a Windows Home computer to connect to a Windows Pro or Enterprise machine.

Before you can access a computer remotely, you must enable Remote Desktop using the following steps:
1.  Right-click the **Start** menu.
2.  Select **System**.
3.  Select **Remote Desktop**.
4.  Toggle the Remote Desktop option to **On**.
5.  Click **Confirm** when asked if you want to allow the function.

### Remote Desktop Connection
Windows Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) is a tool that provides the user access to a Windows desktop from a remote location through a network.

You can use the Windows Remote Desktop Connection tool to connect to another computer using the following steps:
1.  Open the Windows Remote Desktop Connection tool using the Start menu and going to Windows Accessories. Alternatively, you can start this tool by opening **Run**, typing 'mstsc', and pressing **Enter**.
2.  Enter the name or IP address of the computer that you want to connect to.
3.  Click the arrow next to Show Options to configure remote connection settings.
4.  Configure the settings.
5.  Click Connect.
6.  Enter the password for the remote system.
7.  Click Ok.

The following table describes remote connection settings.
#### General
Use the General tab to enter the:
-   Name of the remote computer.
-   Username you want to use to access the remote computer.
#### Display
Use the Display tab to configure the:
-   Size of the remote desktop by dragging the slider between Small and Large (full screen).
-   Color depth of the remote session (15 to 32 bit).
#### Local Resources
Use the Local Resources tab to configure the:
-   Remote audio settings.
-   Windows key combinations.
-   The devices and resources that you want to use in the remote session (printers, Clipboard, smart cards, ports, drives, etc.).

## 8.3.7 Remote Assistance Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:
-   Remote Assistance vs. Remote Desktop
-   Remote Assistance invitation
-   Providing remote assistance
-   Quick Assist

### Remote Assistance vs. Remote Desktop
#### Remote Assistance
- Designed for providing and receiving help
- Remote user gains only partial control of the system
- User remains logged in during the assistance
- The user initiates the session
#### Remote Desktop
- Designed for user productivity
- Remote user gains full control of the system
- Only one user is logged on at a time
- The remote user initiates the session

### Remote Assistance Invitation
You can use Remote Assistance only with the permission of the user who is logged into the system. The user must create an invitation and send it to the administrator.

To request assistance:
-   To enable Remote Assistance:
    -   Type 'remote assistance' into the Search box.
    -   Select **Allow Remote Assistance connections to this computer**.
-   Once enabled:
    -   Type 'remote assistance' into the Search box.
    -   Select **Allow someone you trust to help you**.
-   To create and send an invitation:
    -   Save the invitation as a file.
    -   Send the invitation in an email.
    -   Use Easy Connect.

Once the Remote Assistance session is closed, it is not possible to reconnect to that same session again. If additional help is required, a new Remote Assistance invitation must be issued because the previous one is no longer valid.

### Providing Remote Assistance
If you're helping someone else, you access the same Windows Remote Assistance window, but you select **Help someone who has invited you**. You'll be prompted to enter the information provided to you by the user.

To ensure security, consider the following:
- View Remote Assistance invitations with caution.
- Accept invitations only from people you know and trust. If an invitation comes from outside your company, you may not want to accept it.
- Be aware that an attacker can embed a virus or worm into something that looks like a Remote Assistance invitation.
- Verify all invitations before opening.

### Quick Assist
Quick Assist is a newer Windows app that provides an easy method to receive or provide assistance remotely. To assist another user:

-   Access Quick Assist through the Search box.
-   Select the option to assist another person.
-   Send the six-digit code to the person you want to help.

After the user has entered the six-digit code into Quick Assist, you'll be able to either view the screen or take control of the system.
