## 8.5.3 Update Facts
This lesson covers the following topics:
-   Updates
-   Windows Update
-   Windows as a Service

### Updates
Almost all software needs to be updated. Updates can fix program errors, patch security vulnerabilities, and add features. For these reasons, it's important to keep the operating system, applications, and device drivers up to date.

Consider the following update types:
#### Operating System Updates
Each operating system includes an update feature that keeps the operating system current. Updates may include fixes for known bugs, patches for known security risks, and the addition of new features.
#### Driver Updates
If the hardware manufacturer hasn't registered a driver with Microsoft, updates for the driver aren't made available through the Windows Update service.  
  
If this is the case for a device in your system, check the hardware manufacturer's website. It should provide updated versions of the driver that you can download and install. You should always use the latest versions of the drivers for the hardware in your system.
#### Application Updates
For third-party applications, visit the manufacturer's website and check for updates or configure the application to update itself.  
  
Many applications include an automatic update feature that periodically goes to the manufacturer's website to see if an update is available. Usually, an automatic update feature will prompt you to download and install updates it finds.
#### Firmware Updates
Firmware is software embedded in the flash memory of a hardware device. Like all software, the firmware needs to be updated.  
  
For update instructions, visit the manufacturer's website. When updating firmware, back up the current system firmware first. Most firmware update utilities provide an option to back up the existing firmware before the update in case something goes wrong.

### Windows Update
Windows includes the Windows Update feature to keep the operating system updated. Windows Update automatically identifies, downloads, and installs updates for the operating system, as well as common driver files that have been registered with Microsoft. These updates include:

-   Updates to system files.
-   New features.
-   Hotfixes (small pieces of code designed to correct a known bug).
-   Device drivers.

You can find a listing of all related updates by searching for the operating system in the Microsoft Update Catalog.

>[! bug] Service Packs
>Before Windows 8, Microsoft would occasionally release service packs that included important hotfixes. After Windows 8, Microsoft discontinued service packs and instead released updates in smaller bunches on a more frequent basis.

To determine if you are running the most recent Windows update:
-   Click Start.
-   Click **Settings**.
-   Click **Windows Update**.
-   Click **Check for updates**.

You can configure the following options under Windows Update:
#### Pause Updates
You can pause updates for one week.
#### Update History
You can access the following logs under Update history.
-   Feature updates
-   Quality updates
-   Driver updates
-   Definition updates
-   Other updates

You can also uninstall updates.
#### Advanced Options
The following update options are available:
-   Receive updates for other Microsoft products (toggle on/off).
-   Get me up to date (toggle on/off).
-   Download updates over metered connections (toggle on/off).
-   Notify me when a restart is required to finish updating (on/off).
-   Active hours. The device will not be restarted for updates between set hours.
#### Windows Insider Program
The Windows Insider Program is a software testing program. Users who are running valid instances of Windows can register to receive pre-release builds of the operating system.  
  
There are three insider settings to choose from:
-   Dev channel (recommended for highly technical users).
-   Beta channel (recommended for most users).
-   Release preview (recommended for commercial users).


If you encounter problems when installing a Windows update, consider the following:

-   Restart the computer to apply the update.
-   Verify you have room to install and run updates. You need a minimum of:
    -   16 GB of free space to update a 32-bit machine.
    -   20 GB of free space to update a 64-bit machine.
-   Unplug any external hardware that may be interfering with the upgrade.
-   Update third-party drivers for recently installed hardware.

Check Device Manager to see if there are any errors. A yellow exclamation mark indicates errors. If you have an error symbol next to a device, you can either update the driver or uninstall the driver.

### Windows as a Service
Windows as a Service is a way for IT professionals to provide a streamlined and consistent Windows environment. Note the following about Windows as a Service:

-   Windows 10 and 11 deliver minor updates twice a year (around March and September.)
-   There are two update types:
    -   Feature updates add new functionality to the operating system.
    -   Quality updates provide system fixes and security improvements.
-   There are three release channels for Windows client machines:
    -   General Availability Channel (feature updates are received as soon as they are available to the public.)
    -   Long Term Servicing Channels (designed for specialized devices such as medical equipment.)
    -   Windows Insider Program (provide an opportunity for users to test new features before they are released.)
-   IT professionals can configure Windows Update services on servers. This is beneficial because Windows Update services:
    -   Allow testing of updates before they are deployed.
    -   Ensure that all computers are up to date.
    -   Provide centralized management.

In addition to Windows Update on a stand-alone computer, Windows as a Service can be managed using the following servicing tools:
#### Windows Update for Business
Windows Update for Business allows you to:
-   Manage Windows updates centrally.
-   Postpone deployments for testing up to 365 days.
-   Manage updates using Group Policy or Microsoft Intune.
#### Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)
WSUS is available with the Windows Server operating system. It gives you a high level of control over updates. It allows you to:
-   Defer updates.
-   Approve updates for deployment to specific computers or groups.
#### Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager
Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager provides the highest level of control over updates. It allows you to:
-   Defer or approve updates.
-   Manage targeted deployments.
-   Manage bandwidth usage and deployment times for updates.
