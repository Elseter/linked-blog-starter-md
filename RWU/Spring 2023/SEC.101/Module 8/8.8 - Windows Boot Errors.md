## 8.8.2 Boot Process Facts
- This lesson covers the following
	- Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) boot
	- Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) boot

### BIOS Boot
Windows systems can boot using either a legacy BIOS or a UEFI boot sequence. Understanding these boot sequences enables you to focus troubleshooting efforts on the most likely errors.  

The following diagram and table describe the four basic stages of the Legacy BIOS boot sequence:
![[Pasted image 20230320210132.png]]

#### POST (Power-On Self Test)
On a system using BIOS, the following steps take place:

1.  Power is supplied to the CPU. The CPU is hard-coded to look at a particular memory address containing a pointer (or jump program) that instructs the CPU where to find the BIOS program.
2.  The CPU loads the BIOS program. The first BIOS process to run is the POST, which verifies the integrity of the BIOS code. POST also:
    -   Locates, sizes, and verifies system memory.
    -   Verifies and initializes video card (output displays on the monitor).
    -   Identifies available hard disks.
3.  After POST tests are complete, the BIOS:
    -   Identifies other system devices.
    -   Uses CMOS settings and information supplied by the devices to identify and configure hardware devices.
    -   Allocates system resources to plug-and-play devices.
    -   Typically displays information about the keyboard, mouse, and SATA drives.
    -   Displays information about devices and system resources.
4.  The BIOS then searches for a boot drive using the boot order specified in the CMOS.
>[! tip] Tip
>During this sequence, system information displays on the screen, and the option to enter the CMOS setup to configure system parameters is available.
#### Boot Loader
During the boot loader stage, the following process occurs:

1.  On the boot device, the BIOS searches for and loads the boot code in the master boot record (MBR). The MBR is located in the first sector on the disk.
2.  The MBR boot code uses the partition table to identify the active disk partition.
3.  On the active partition, MBR boot code looks for and loads the bootmgr.exe program.
4.  The bootmgr.exe program looks for the binary-coded decimal (BCD) store in either the C:\ directory or the System Reserved partition. The BCD store contains a list of all Windows installations on the disk.
5.  If only one installation exists, bootmgr.exe automatically loads the operating system (OS). If multiple installations exist, it displays a list of bootable operating systems.
>[! tip] Tip
>This stage occurs after the BIOS information screen disappears but before the Windows loading screen displays.
#### OS Startup
During this stage, the operating system starts. The operating system configures system devices and loads necessary files. The following process occurs:

1.  The operating system loader winload.exe starts. At this stage, you can access advanced startup options (e.g., safe mode) by pressing the F8 key (on most computers). winload.exe loads the following:
    -   System registry.
    -   Ntoskrnl.exe.
    -   Essential device drivers.
2.  Control of the system passes to ntoskrnl.exe.
3.  At this point, the Windows logo displays and ntoskrnl.exe:
    -   Loads device drivers.
    -   Starts services.
    -   Configures the OS environment.
#### Logon and User Configuration
After configuring the operating system and devices, the system waits for user logon. Following logon, the operating system is configured with user-specific settings.

1.  The wininit and winlogon programs run to allow user logon. At this point, the Welcome or user logon screen displays.
2.  Following logon, all remaining device drivers and user settings load. In addition, the current configuration profile is copied to the Last Known Good Configuration registry.

### UEFI Boot
UEFI is a newer boot specification that defines the software interface between an operating system and the computer's firmware. The following diagram and table describe the stages of the UEFI boot sequence.
![[Pasted image 20230320210405.png]]

#### Security (SEC) 
Immediately after the system is powered on, the SEC sequence begins.
1.  Power is supplied to the CPU.
2.  The CPU switches from 16-bit Real Mode to 64-bit Protected Mode.
3.  The CPU executes a specific set of instructions to prepare the system for the Pre-EFI Initialization (PEI) to run.
#### Pre-EFI Initialization
PEI initializes the system and prepares for the Driver Execution Environment (DXE).
1.  The CPU and chipset are verified and fully initialized.
2.  System memory is initialized, verified, and allocated.
3.  PEI modules are loaded to allocate system resources.
4.  The DXE is initialized, and the system is prepared to transition to DXE.
#### Driver Execution Environment
DXE initializes configured devices, mounts drives, and prepares to boot the OS.
1.  Device drivers load into memory.
2.  Hardware devices (e.g., video card, network card, USB controllers) initialize simultaneously.
3.  System drives mount and initialize.
4.  The EFI boot manager initializes.
#### Boot Device Selection (BDS)
The BDS stage runs the EFI boot manager, which identifies the system's boot configuration settings and decides how to boot the system.
-   If an EFI System Partition (ESP) exists, the following process occurs:
    1.  On the ESP in the \EFI\Microsoft directory, the boot manager looks for and runs the bootmgfw.efi file.
    2.  The bootmgfw.efi looks for the BCD store in the same directory containing a list of all Windows installations.
    3.  If only one installation exists, UEFI automatically loads it. If multiple installations exist, a list of bootable operating systems displays.
-   If no ESP exists, the boot manager uses Legacy BIOS mode to complete the boot sequence:
    1.  The MBR looks for and loads the bootmgr.exe program.
    2.  The bootmgr.exe program looks for the BCD store in either the C:\ directory or the System Reserved partition.
    3.  If only one installation exists, bootmgr.exe automatically loads the OS. If multiple installations exist, a list of bootable operating systems displays.
>[! Tip]
>At the beginning of the BDS stage, the UEFI interface executes. The option to load the EFI Shell or enter the UEFI configuration is available.
#### Transient System Load (TSL)
During TSL stage, the operating system loader is located and booted.
1.  The BCD store identifies the location of the operating system loader (for Windows, the default location is C:\Windows\system32\winload.efi).
2.  The operating system loader winload.efi is started.
3.  Winload.efi then loads the following elements:
    -   System registry.
    -   Ntoskrnl.exe.
    -   Essential device drivers.
#### Run Time (RT)
After the operating system and devices are configured, the system waits for user logon. Following logon, the operating system is configured with user-specific settings.
1.  Control of the system passes to ntoskrnl.exe.
2.  The Windows logo displays and ntoskrnl.exe:
    -   Loads device drivers.
    -   Starts services.
    -   Configures the OS environment.
3.  The wininit and winlogon programs run to allow user logon. The Welcome screen displays.
4.  Following logon, all remaining device drivers and user settings load. In addition, the current configuration profile copies to the Last Known Good Configuration registry.

>[! TIP]
>Even though it has more stages, the UEFI boot sequence is considerably faster than the BIOS boot sequence.

## 8.8.6 Windows Boot Options
- This less on covers the following:
	- Boot Options
	- Startup Error Troubleshooting

### Boot options
If a system will not start or has significant problems, you can boot the system in various modes that may help you get the system up and running. There are two main ways you can select an alternate boot mode.

To restart the device to change startup settings, including starting from a disc or USB drive:

-   Select **Start**.
-   Select **Settings**.
-   Select **System**.
-   Under **Recovery options**, select **Restart now**.

Alternately, you can run the msconfig.exe utility to specify the boot mode to use and then reboot the system.
- Only a subset of advanced boot options is available in msconfig

The following table describes the startup modes:
#### Enable debugging
This option starts Windows in an advanced troubleshooting mode. Programmers, not administrators, typically use this option.
#### Enable Boot Logging
- This option creates a log file named Ntbtlog.txt in C:\Windows during startup. This file contains an entry for each driver loaded during the boot process.  
- If the system does not complete a regular boot, you can look at this file to see the last driver to load before the failure occurs.
#### Enable Low-Resolution Video
- This option loads Windows using the current video driver but configures it to use low-resolution settings and a slow refresh rate.  
- This option is useful when the wrong video configuration settings cause the screen to be unreadable. Selecting this option gives you the ability to restore the correct video settings.
#### Enable Safe Mode
- Only essential drivers and services (e.g., generic mouse, monitor, base storage device, keyboard, video drivers, and the Event Log service) load when a computer boots in Safe Mode.  
- This allows you to troubleshoot misbehaving applications, services, and drivers.
#### Enable Safe Mode with Networking
- Safe Mode with Networking is a variation of Safe Mode that also loads a network driver and protocol so the system can communicate on the network.
- This option is useful when you must download an updated driver from the internet and install it on the system to correct a problem.
#### Enable safe mode with command prompt
Safe Mode with Command Prompt starts the computer in safe mode and displays a command prompt.
#### Disable Driver Signature Enforcement
Selecting this option causes Windows to not require a digital signature when loading a driver.
#### Disable Early Launch Anti-Malware Protection
This option prevents the early launch anti-malware driver from loading when you boot the system. This could increase the system's exposure to rootkit malware packages.
#### Disable Automatic Restart on System Failure
By default, Windows reboots whenever a critical system error occurs (e.g., blue screen of death).
-   You have only a short time before the system reboots when the error occurs. This might not be sufficient time to read and record the error information.
-   If the error occurs while you are away from the computer, you will see a message that the system restarted, but won't have seen the error.
-   If the error occurs during startup, the system might continually reboot.
Use this option on the advanced boot menu to stop the automatic reboots.
#### Launch Recovery Environment
Use this option to access system recovery tools, such as:
-   System Restore
-   System Image Recovery
-   Startup Repair
-   Command Prompt
-   Go Back to the Previous Build

### System Error Troubleshooting
Use the following recommendations to troubleshoot startup errors with the advanced boot options.
-   Boot into Safe Mode and then use the appropriate tool to undo any recent changes. For example, you can:
    -   Use Device Manager to roll back drivers or disable devices that might be causing the problem.
    -   Use Add or Remove Programs to uninstall software that has just been added.
    -   Restore any settings that may have changed.
    -   Disable unneeded services or applications that load at startup.
    -   Use System Restore to restore the system to a known good restore point.
-   After booting into Safe Mode, begin by undoing the most recent change to the system. For example, if the problem started after installing a new device driver, roll back the driver and reboot.
-   If undoing recent changes does not fix the problem, you could disable all unnecessary devices and services. If you can boot normally, you can identify the component that was causing the problem by enabling devices and services one-by-one until the system becomes unstable.

## 8.8.8 Startup Error Facts
- This lesson covers startup error facts
### Startup Error Facts
The following table contains a description of common startup errors:
#### System does not power on
If the system does not power on:
-   Ensure the system is plugged in and the power strip or UPS is turned on.
-   Check the power switch and the power type (110 or 220 volts) on the back of the power supply.
-   Make sure the battery is installed (if the computer is a notebook or tablet). Ensure that the AC adapter is plugged in.
-   Make sure the system case power switch connects to the motherboard (if you have just installed a new system).

When you turn on the computer, you should hear both the power supply fan and the CPU fan start to spin.

#### System powers on, but no display is visible
If the system powers on but there is nothing on the display, check the following:
-   Ensure the monitor is connected to the computer, plugged in, and turned on.
-   Verify that the BIOS/UEFI is configured to use the correct video adapter. You can configure most motherboards to use either the integrated video adapter or a PCIe video adapter installed in an expansion slot.
-   Verify that the CPU, memory, and a video card are correctly installed. To display startup information on the screen, the computer needs these three components. Other components are not necessary.
    -   If necessary, reduce the system to the three components listed above and try starting the system.
    -   If that does not work, swap out components to identify the failed component.

Some computers use a series of beeps to indicate specific problems when messages cannot be shown on the screen. In this case, consult the motherboard documentation for the meaning of the audible messages.

#### Corrupt MBR or partition table
The master boot record (MBR) is responsible for locating the system (active) partition and loading the volume boot record (VBR). A corrupt or missing master boot record or a corrupt partition table prevents the system from loading the boot record code, finding the volume boot record, and loading the boot loader program.  
  
Symptoms of a corrupt MBR or partition table include:
-   The system hangs immediately after the BIOS information displays.
-   Any of the following errors:
    -   MBR corrupt.
    -   Invalid partition table.
    -   Error loading operating system.
    -   Missing operating system.

To fix the problem, boot the system from the installation disc and repair the system.

#### Corrupt boot sector
The boot sector (also called the volume boot record or volume boot code) is responsible for loading the operating system boot loader program (BOOTMGR).  
  
At this point in the process, the MBR has loaded, located an active partition, but there is a problem in loading the VBR: either the VBR does not specify a boot loader program or the boot loader specified in the VBR is missing or corrupt. Symptoms of a corrupt or missing boot sector include:
-   System hangs following the BIOS information screen.
-   Any of the following errors:
    -   Non-system disk or disk error.
    -   Remove disks or other media.
    -   Invalid system disk.
    -   Invalid media type.
    -   Disk boot failure.
    -   A disk read error occurred.
    -   BOOTMGR is missing.
    -   Missing GRUB/LILO.

To correct the problem, you can check the boot order in the BIOS/UEFI to make sure the system is booting from the correct storage device. Then, boot from the installation disk and repair the system.

If the device is a removable media device, the drive should be empty (so the drive is skipped when checking for a boot disk) or the drive must have media that includes a bootable partition for the system to boot from that drive.

A common cause of the non-system disk error is leaving a USB device plugged in. You can avoid these errors by disabling the USB Device option in the boot sequence or setting the integrated USB controller to No Boot.

#### Inaccessible boot disk
The boot loader program uses the boot configuration database (BCD) to locate valid Windows installations to start. If the database points to a location that does not include operating system files, you will see a message similar to the following:

"Windows could not start because of a computer disk hardware configuration problem. Could not read from the selected boot disk. Check boot path and disk hardware."

To correct the problem, boot the system from the installation disc and repair the system.

#### Missing or Corrupt file
If the Boot Manager cannot locate needed operating system files on the selected boot partition, you might see the following errors occur:

-   Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: < _filename_> Please re-install a copy of the above file.
-   A blue screen error that describes a corrupt or missing file.

This problem is caused either by a corrupt disk, corrupt files, or missing files. To correct the problem, boot the system from the installation disc and repair the system.

#### Blue/black screen or system hangs after Windows splash screen is displayed
The most common cause of the errors is bad drivers or corrupt registry settings. To correct the problem, try the following (in this order):

-   If the error includes any error codes or messages, check the Microsoft website for troubleshooting information.
-   If you can, boot the system into Safe Mode. In Safe Mode, roll back drivers, remove drivers, or restore to a restore point.
-   To identify the driver causing the problem, enable boot logging, then read the Ntbtlog.txt file to identify the last driver that the system tried to load.
-   If you cannot boot into Safe Mode, boot into the Recovery Environment and use System Restore to restore to a restore point created when the system was working correctly.

#### Service Fails to Start
If a service fails to start, you will see a message such as:
"At least one service or driver failed during system startup. Use Event Viewer to examine the event log for details."

Use Event Viewer to view details about the service that did not start. Then try starting the service manually. If necessary, re-enable or re-install the service.

#### Corrupt or missing DLL or system file
If you see corrupt or missing DLL or system file errors (either during startup or after Windows starts) boot the system from the installation disc and repair the system.

#### Device fails to start
This message indicates that a hardware device could not be started. Begin by checking Device Manager for information about the device. If necessary, update the driver or disable the device.
