## 8.7.7 System Recovery Facts
- This lesson covers the following topics
	- System Recovery Procedures
	- Windows Recovery Options
	- Windows Installation Media

### System Recovery Procedures
System recovery procedures are necessary when you can't boot the computer or when other problems prevent it from working correctly. Before using recovery tools, try other methods to resolve the issue, including:
-   Remove problematic hardware or software.
-   Update drivers, applications, and operating system files.
-   Boot into safe mode to disable devices or roll back drivers.

### Windows Recovery Options
The Windows 11 provides Windows Recovery Environment (winRE) for Windows systems that won't boot. You can access the following options in winRE.
#### Reset this PC
Use Reset this PC option if the system is not working after recently installing an application; an application update; or a driver install or update.  
  
To reset the PC:
1.  Go to Start > Settings > **Recovery**
2.  Select **Reset PC**
3.  Select either **Keep my files** or **Remove everything**
#### System Restore
Use System Restore on a computer that isn't working correctly after installing or updating an application.  
  
System Restore enables you to restore a system to a previous state if System Protection is on. Windows 11 creates restore points automatically. You can create additional restore points using the Recovery option in the Control Panel. When you use a restore point:
- System changes made since the restore point are reversed. Any applications, device drivers, or patches installed since the restore point was created are removed when the system reverts to that restore point.
- User data is not affected. Any files that changed since the restore point was created remain unchanged when the system reverts to that restore point.  
    
- If you choose to restore, the process cannot be undone. You have the option of canceling, but you must do it from the initial screen. Don't try to cancel after you start the restore process.

If the system can boot into Windows, use System Restore as follows:
1.  Go to Start > Control Panel > Recovery > **System Restore.**
2.  Under the Restore system files and setting box, select **Next**.
3.  Select the restore point you wish to use.
4.  Select **Scan for affected programs**. Once the scan is complete, a list of items that will be deleted displays.
5.  Select **Close**.
6.  Select **Next**.
7.  Select **Finish**.
#### Restore Files
When you restore files from a backup, you restore the file as it existed at the most recent backup. You can restore individual files or complete folders from the backup.  
  
Restore files using Backup and Restore by following these steps:
1.  Connect to drive that contains backup files.
2.  Type 'control panel' in the Search box.
3.  Select the Control Panel app.
4.  Click **Backup and Restore (Windows 7)**.
5.  Click **Select another backup to restore files from**.
6.  Select the drive that contains backup files.
7.  Follow the instructions to restore files.
#### Reimage
The Backup and Restore option can create an image of a Windows 11 computer. A system image:  
-   Creates a full backup of the drive.
-   Can be used to restore the system in the event of a system failure.
-   Is about the size of a regular system partition but can vary depending on how much information you choose to backup.

To restore a system image:  
1.  Go to Start > **Settings**.
2.  Click **Recovery** under the System options.
3.  Click **Restart now** under Advanced startup.
4.  Click **Troubleshoot**.
5.  Click **Advanced options**.
6.  Click **System image recovery**.
7.  Choose the system image to be restored.
8.  Click **Next**.
9.  Follow the prompts to restore the system image.

**If Windows won't boot, you can access the following options in the Windows Recovery Environment.**
#### System Repair
The repair process:
-   Inspects and repairs the boot sector.
-   Verifies that Windows boot files exist and are correctly configured.
-   Compares the checksum for all Windows system files to ensure they match what's on the installation disc.

To get to Startup Repair, access the Windows Recovery Environment (winRE) using the following steps:
1.  Press and hold the power button for 10 seconds until the computer shuts down.
2.  Press the power button again to turn the computer on.
3.  When you see a logo flash on the screen, press the power button for 10 seconds to turn off the device again.
4.  Press the power button again to turn the computer back on.
5.  When you see a logo flash on the screen, press the power button for 10 seconds to turn off the device again.
6.  Press the power button again to turn the computer back on.
7.  Wait for the system to start up.
8.  Select **Advanced options** on the Automatic Repair screen.
9.  Click **Troubleshoot**.
10.  Click **Advanced options**.
11.  Click **Startup repair**.
12.  Click **Restart**.
#### Recovery Drive
If the system was purchased from a major PC manufacturer, it might include a recovery partition on the hard drive.
-   Using the recovery disc/partition restores the system to the state when it shipped.
-   The recovery process typically restores a Windows image, which erases the hard drive.
-   Any applications and user data files added since the system was shipped will be lost. If possible, back up any data accessible on the hard disk before recovering.
-   If the system has a recovery partition, the partition might not be visible from within the operating system. To use the recovery partition, edit the BIOS, or boot using a special key combination specified by the manufacturer.

To restore or recover from a recovery drive:
1.  Press the power button.
2.  Press the **Windows logo key** + **L** to access the sign-in screen.
3.  Restart the PC and press the Shift key while selecting the **Restart** option.
4.  The computer should restart in the Windows Recovery Environment.
5.  Select **Troubleshoot**.
6.  Follow the prompts to restore the system or reinstall Windows.
#### Uninstall Windows Update
If a system stopped working after a recently installed update, remove the installed Windows update to see if the problem is resolved.  
  
To uninstall a Windows update:
1.  Go to Start > Settings > **Windows Update**.
2.  Select **Update history.**
3.  Select **Uninstall updates.**
4.  Select the update that you want to install and select **Uninstall**.

### Windows Installation Media
You may need to restore or install from the Windows installation media in some instances.
#### Restore with installation media
To use installation media to restore Windows:
1.  Use another computer to access the Microsoft software download website.
2.  Access and download the Windows 11 media creation tool.
3.  Run the Windows 11 media creation tool.
4.  Click **Create installation media for another PC**.
5.  Select the appropriate language, edition, and indicate whether you are restoring a 32-bit or 64-bit system.
6.  Follow the prompts to create the installation media.
7.  Click **Finish**.
8.  Connect the installation media to the computer that isn't starting correctly.
9.  Press the **power button**.
10.  Follow the prompts provided by the installation disk. If you do not receive a prompt from the installation media, consult the manufacturer's documentation to ensure the computer is set to boot from the selected drive.
11.  Click **Repair the computer**.
12.  Click **Troubleshoot**.
13.  Follow the prompts to restore from a system restore point.
#### Reinstall with installation media
If the PC will not start and you have not created a recovery drive, you can use the installation media to reinstall Windows 11.  
  
To use installation media to reinstall Windows:
1.  Connect installation media to the computer.
2.  Open File Explorer.
3.  Select the drive containing the installation media.
4.  Click the file **setup.exe**.
5.  Select **Yes** when prompted, to allow the app to make changes to the device.
6.  Choose one of the following options:
    -   Keep personal files and apps.
    -   Keep personal files only.
    -   Keep nothing.
7.  Select **Next**. The computer will restart several times.
