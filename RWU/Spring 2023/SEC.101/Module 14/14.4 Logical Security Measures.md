## 14.4.2 Logical Security Measures Facts
Physical security is just one aspect of securing devices and networks. Logical security plays just as important a role as physical security. Logical security refers to the security measures implemented through the operating system and software.

This lesson covers the following topics:
-   Authentication methods
-   Mobile device management
-   Certificate manager

### Authentication Methods
Authentication is the process in which users provide credentials to prove their identity. Once a user is authenticated, they are then given access to the resources they have been authorized for. Users should be authorized for access to only the resources they need to perform their job. This is known as the principle of least privilege and should be adhered to whenever assigning access rights for users.

Access control lists (ACLs) are used to manage and enforce what a user is authorized to access. On a local Windows system, the ACL is stored in the Master File Table (MFT) which is a special partition created during the Windows installation process. When changes are made to a file or folder's permissions, those changes are updated in the ACL.

Authentication methods fall under one of three categories:

-   Something you know
	-   Username and password
-   Something you have
	-   Smart card, security token, etc.
-   Something you are
	-   Biometrics

To improve security, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can be utilized. MFA simply means that at least two authentication categories are used to authenticate a user.

Both soft tokens and hard tokens can be used to authenticate users. The following table describes these tokens:
#### Soft Token
A soft token is any digital authentication key used to authenticate a user. The following are examples of a soft token:  

-   One-time codes are sent through email, SMS text message, or voice phone call to prove a user's identity. These codes are typically sent after a user has attempted to login to a website or device with their username and password.

-   The username and password falls under the authentication category of something you know
-   The one-time code falls under that category of something you have because only the user should have physical access to their phone or email.

-   Authentication apps are installed on a user's smart phone or tablet. When the user attempts to login using their username and password, they must also open the authentication app to approve the login.

-   The authentication app falls under the category of something you have because only the user should have access to the device the app is installed on.
#### Hard Token
Hard tokens are hardware authentication devices that the user must have possession of to authenticate themselves. Hard tokens provide a higher level of security, but if the token is lost or stolen, the security breach can be quite severe. Implementing hard tokens can be expensive and time-consuming and is typically reserved for those users that are accessing highly sensitive data.  
The following are some examples of hard tokens:  

-   USB security devices which need to be plugged in to authenticate the user.
-   Key fobs which use a wireless radio or RFID signal to authenticate the user
-   Smart cards which use a RFID or NFC signal to authenticate the user.

Implementing multi-factor authentication greatly increases the security of any device or network system.

### Mobile Device Management
The term Mobile Device Management (MDM) generally describes the policies and procedures used by an organization to maintain security and permissions on mobile devices. More specifically, MDM software is used by administrators to secure mobile devices and to enforce enterprise policies on the devices. MDM software usually offers a suite of features, including:

-   Policy management
-   Security management
-   Inventory management
-   Telecom service management
-   Mobile application management.

MDM software is often used alongside a bring your own device (BYOD) policy. BYOD is the policy that allows employees to use their own computers and mobile devices for work purposes. A BYOD policy encourages company employees not only to work on the device they choose, but the device they own for personal use.  

MDM software can mitigate BYOD risks while taking advantage of the benefits. MDM software is typically deployed as a combination of an on-device application or agent that communicates with a backend server. The application receives policies and settings from the server to configure and control the mobile device.

  
The following table lists a few MDM security features:
#### Passcode
Set this policy to require a device to have a passcode for access. A device will be unable to connect unless an appropriate passcode is used.
#### Lockout Policies
Lockout policies allow the administrator to remotely lock the device if it has been lost or stolen. This ensures that unauthorized users will be unable to access the device.
#### Remote Wipe Policy
This policy allows the administrator to completely remove data from the mobile device remotely if it has been lost or stolen.
#### Root or Jailbreak Detection
Jailbreaking or rooting a device can lead to security concerns and these devices should not be allowed to connect to organizational resources. This policy will detect if a device has been rooted or modified in some way and will deny access.
#### Alerts and Monitoring 
The MDM agent can send real-time alerts and resource monitoring data. This helps the administrators know immediately if anything on the device falls outside the norms. This could indicate a problem with the device or possible theft.

### Certificate Manager
Digital certificates are used to identify a user, computer, or an organization. There are many different types of digital certificates and they can be used in a variety of ways for authentication.

One common method used to create a digital certificate is to use a private key and public key pair. The public key is stored with the certificate and the private is kept safe by the owner. During the authentication process, the certificate is used to match the keys. If the keys are confirmed as a pair, the user will be authenticated.

Managing the many different certificates on a workstation can be a tedious process, however, the Windows Certificate Manager applet can be used to manage all certificates. Certificates can be stored for users, websites, network devices, and others in the Certificate Manager.

Enterprise users can also use the Certificate manager to:
-   Create self-signed certificates
-   Backup the certificate database
-   Import certificates manually
