## 7.1.6 Management Consoles
Microsoft Windows contains management consoles that give users and administrators the ability to configure and modify different tasks. Microsoft Management Console and Computer Manager are two utilities included with Windows.

This lesson covers the following topics:
-   Microsoft Management Console
-   Computer Management

### Microsoft Management Console
The Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is a framework that provides a common user interface for performing system administration tasks. Management of a set of related features is done by adding snap-ins to the console. The MMC provides the shell for running these snap-ins, while the snap-ins provide the details for performing specific management tasks. Microsoft provides snap-ins for managing:

-   Local Users and Groups
-   Device Manager
-   Disk Management
-   Print Management
-   Component Services
-   Windows Firewall with Advanced Security

To open a blank console, type **mmc** in the search field on the taskbar and then select **mmc** from the Best match list. You can then add snap-ins to work with the configuration of your system. The console consists of three panes:

-   The tree pane (on the left) organizes objects in a hierarchy.
-   The results pane (in the middle) shows objects and configuration options.
-   The actions pane (on the right) lists the actions you can take on objects.

You can save a console that includes the snap-ins you use most (saved consoles have the .msc extension). Microsoft provides a number of preconfigured consoles that include snap-ins for common tasks.

### System Information Tools
Microsoft Windows contains tools to view details about computer hardware and software settings. The following table describes some of these tools.

#### System Information  (Msinfo32.exe)
You can use System Information to view hardware and configuration information for the computer. While much of this information is available through other tools, System Information provides a single location for viewing information such as:

-   Operating system version.
-   Computer manufacturer, processor type, available memory.
-   Installed devices and drivers used.
-   Running tasks.
-   Applications that run at system startup.
-   Services loaded on the system.

You can view or export configuration settings in System Information. You can't modify them.

#### Event Viewer
You can use Event Viewer to view logs about programs, system events, and security. Each entry is listed as a warning, error, or information event. Events display in the following logs:

-   The Application log contains all application-related events such as application installations, un-installations, and application errors.
-   The System log contains all system-related events such as system modifications, malfunctions, and errors.
-   The Security log contains all security-related events such as security modifications and user login events.

Applications or services can add logs.  
You can attach a task to an event. If you want to have a regularly occurring event flagged, you:

1.  Right-click the event.
2.  Click **Attach Task to this Event**.
3.  Name the task in the Create a Basic Task Wizard.
4.  Click **Next**.
5.  Click **Next** again after the Create a Basic Task wizard auto-fills in the log, the source, and event ID.
6.  Specify the type of task to create (start a program, send an email, or display a message). The only option given is Start a program, as the other two options are deprecated.
7.  Click **Next**.
8.  Specify the script desired to run when the event happens.

#### Performance Monitor
Performance Monitor displays statistics about the operation of the computer.

-   A counter identifies a specific statistic, such as % Processor Time or % Disk Free Space.
-   You can add or remove counters to customize the statistics you see.
-   Real-time data are displayed in a graph.
-   Performance Monitor by itself does not save any data. To save statistics, use a data collector set.

#### Reliability Monitor
Reliability Monitor maintains historical data that describe the operating system's stability.

-   Overall system stability is given a stability index that ranges from 1 to 10 (10 is the most stable). Application, hardware, Windows, and other failures affect the stability rating.
-   Reliability Monitor shows an historical chart that identifies when software installs/uninstalls and failures occur. You can click a day to view the changes affecting system stability on that day.

#### Windows Memory Diagnostics
The Windows Memory Diagnostic tests the Random Access Memory (RAM) on your computer for errors. This utility is included with Windows 7 through Windows 11. To launch the tool, you can run mdsched.exe, or type "Windows Memory Diagnostic" in Windows search.


### System Configuration Utility (msconfig.exe)
Use the System Configuration utility to configure the system to enable optimal troubleshooting and diagnosis of technical issues. System Configuration Utility has the following tabs:

#### General
The General tab displays by default when you open the System Configuration Utility. The three options under the General tab are:

-   Normal Startup loads all device drivers and services when Windows starts up.
-   Diagnostic Startup loads only the basic devices and services. It is similar to starting Windows in safe mode.
-   Selective Startup allows the user to choose what starts with Windows.

#### Boot
The Boot tab shows the operating system installed on the computer. This tab contains some of the following options:

-   Boot Options allow the user to select options such as Safe boot along with additional options.
-   Timeout specifies the number of seconds Windows displays the Boot menu before loading the operating system. The default is 30 seconds.

#### Services
The Services tab displays all the services configured to start when the operating system boots. Uncheck services that you do not want Windows to start.

#### Startup
With Windows 10, the Startup tab in System Configuration Utility displays a shortcut to the Startup tab in Task Manager.

#### Tools
The Tools tab displays utilities and tools that you can launch directly from the System Configuration Utility.

### System Configuration Tools
Microsoft Windows contains the following tools to configure options.

#### Microsoft Registry Editor  (Regedit.exe)
Microsoft Registry Editor modifies entries in the Windows registry. The registry is a database that holds hardware, software, and user configuration settings.

-   Whenever you change preferences, software, hardware, and user-settings, the registry stores and reflects those settings.
-   The preferred method of modifying the registry is to use applications or management tools that write to the registry. For example, many Control Panel applets make changes to registry settings.
-   You must directly edit the registry to make some advanced settings.

#### DirectX Diagnostic Tool  (DxDiag)
DxDiag shows information related to DirectX operation. DirectX is a set of programming interfaces for multimedia (video and audio). DxDiag displays information such as:

-   Operating system version.
-   Processor and memory information.
-   DirectX version.
-   Settings and drivers used by display devices.
-   Audio drivers.

#### Command Prompt
You can use Command Prompt to execute command-line commands. To open a command prompt:

-   Type 'CMD' into the Search box on the taskbar.
-   Click the Command Prompt app to open it.

Some commands you launch from the command line may require elevated privileges to run. If this is the case, run Command Prompt as Administrator.  
  
To get help with the Command Prompt, you have two options:

-   Enter the name of the command, type '/?', and press Enter. Windows opens a help screen that gives valuable information about the command.

-   Enter 'help _name of the command_'. This prompts Windows to open the same help screen as the /? prompt.

You can use the Command Prompt to manage processes on the local computer and on remote connections. To manage remote connections, use the mstc command to establish a remote connection with another computer on the network.

#### Services
A service is a program that processes requests from other applications or users. Services can start automatically and stay constantly running in the background, waiting for service requests.  
  
Use the Services snap-in to view and manage running services. The service startup behavior determines how the service is started.

-   When set to Automatic, Windows automatically starts the service when the system boots.
-   When set to Manual, you must manually start the service.
-   When Disabled, the service will not run.

#### Microsoft Terminal Services Client (mstsc)
The Microsoft Terminal Services Client is a remote management service. mstsc.exe is the executable file that opens the Microsoft Terminal Services Client.  
  
The Microsoft Terminal Services Client, which is Remote Desktop Services (RDS), is a component of Microsoft Windows that allows users to take control of remote computers over a network connection. The three Windows components that use RDS are:

-   Windows Remote Assistance
-   Remote Desktop Connection
-   Fast User Switching

#### Notepad
Notepad is a simple text editor for Microsoft Windows. It is a basic text-editing program that enables computer users to create documents. Notepad can be launched from the Start button, from Windows Accessories, and by selecting Notepad.

#### Explorer
Explorer, called File Explorer (formerly Windows Explorer), is a file manager application that comes with Microsoft Windows. File Explorer's main purpose is to let you view, open, copy, move, and otherwise manage the files and folders.

#### Disk Defragmenter
Disk Defragmenter is a utility in Microsoft Windows designed to increase access speed by rearranging files stored on a disk to occupy contiguous storage locations. The process of doing this is called defragmentation (defrag).

#### System Restore
System Restore is a recovery tool for Microsoft Windows that allows you to reverse certain changes made to the operating system.  
  
You can use System Restore to return important Windows files and settings (including drivers, registry keys, system files, and installed programs) back to previous settings and versions.

#### Windows Update
Windows Update is a Microsoft service for Windows. It automates downloading and installing software updates over a network or the internet.

#### Microsoft Register Server  (Regsvr32.exe)
Microsoft Register Server is a command-line tool that registers .dll files as command components in the registry.

#### Data Sources
You use the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) Data Source Administrator to create and manage ODBC data sources. To open the ODBC Data Source Administrator in Windows 10, you:

1.  Select **Start**.
2.  Go to Windows System > Control Panel > System and Security > **Administrative Tools**.
3.  In Administrative Tools, select **Data Sources (ODBC)**.

To open the ODBC Data Source Administrator in Windows 11, you:

1.  Select **Start**.
2.  Enter 'ODBC' in the search field.
3.  Select the desired ODBC Data Source application version (either the 32-bit or the 64-bit).
4.  Click to open.

#### Advanced Security
Everyday configuration tasks for the Windows Firewall are completed using the Windows Firewall applet in Control Panel. To perform advanced firewall configuration tasks, use the MMC snap-in Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.  
  
Windows Firewall with Advanced Security supports a more granular firewall configuration than you can create using the Windows Firewall applet in Control Panel. For example, it can filter traffic based on parameters such as:

-   Source IP address
-   Destination IP address
-   Port number
-   ICMP protocol
