## 6.1.2 Installation Planning facts 
- This lesson will cover the following topics
	- Installation Type
	- Installation preparation methods

### Installation Type
#### Upgrade
- Upgrade installations assumed you are currently running an earlier version of Windows and you want to upgrade to a newer version while preserving the existing data, settings, and applications currently installed.
#### Custom/Clean
You can perform a custom install, also known as a clean install, on an existing or new system. It overwrites any existing data on the storage device and installs a fresh instance of an operating system with default settings.

You use a custom installation of Windows in any of the following situations:

-   There is no operating system installed on the computer.
-   The installed operating system does not support an upgrade installation to the Windows version you are installing.
-   You want to keep the existing operating system installed on the system and deploy Windows as a separate instance on the same device, creating a multiple-boot configuration.
#### Repair Installation
- Also known as an in-place installation, a repair installation assumes you are already running a version of Windows. A repair installation installs a new build over the current installation. This process repairs registry entries and working files without losing applications or user information.

### Installation Preparation Steps
#### Verify system compatibility
Verify that the system is compatible with the operating system to be installed. These requirements include drive space, memory, processor speed, display, and so on. You can find system requirements on Microsoftâ€™s website.

The minimum system requirements for a Windows 11 installation are:
-   Central processing unit (CPU):
    -   Microsoft approved CPU.
    -   1 GHz or faster.
    -   2 or more cores.
-   Storage - 64 GB or more.
-   RAM - 4 GB.
-   Graphics - DirectX12 compatibility or later with a WDDM 2.0 driver.
-   Display:
    -   HD 720p display.
    -   9" or more diagonally (any smaller may result in part of the user interface being hidden from view).
    -   8 bits per color channel.
-   Internet connectivity (for initial install).
-   Microsoft account (for initial install).

#### Back up existing data
- It is highly recommended that you back up all data you do not want to lose.
#### Locate application and software license keys
- All applications on the destination machine will need to be reinstalled after performing a clean installation of Windows. Make sure you have access to the media required to install these applications and the associated license keys.
#### Locate third-party drivers
- Gather any third-party installation media or drivers that may be needed for the connected devices.
#### Create a system image
- An optional step is to create an image of the source computer. An image is an exact copy of the hard disk data in the form of a file. A disk image lets you restore the computer to its original state if the clean install fails or does not support the required software on the original computer.
#### Obtain the installation media and product key
- Installation media can be obtained from a retail store or by creating the media using the Media Creation Tool. The product key can come from the retail store or through a Microsoft License Agreement.
#### Verify software compatibility
Ensure that all software is compatible with the new operating system.
-   Keep in mind that the specifications listed for a software application are usually minimal and are not guaranteed to provide optimal performance.
-   Be sure that the current system will be able to handle the increased system demands of the new operating system and the desired software applications.
