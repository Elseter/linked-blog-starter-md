## 6.3.2 Cloud Computing
- This lesson covers the following topics
	- Cloud Computing
	- Cloud Computing advantages
	- Cloud Computing service models

### Cloud Computing
_Cloud computing_ is a combination of software, data access, computation, and storage services provided to clients through the internet.
-   The cloud is a metaphor for the internet, based on the basic cloud drawing used to represent the telephone network. It is now used to describe the internet infrastructure in computer network diagrams.
-   Typical cloud computing providers deliver common business applications that are accessed from a web service or software (such as a web browser).
-   The cloud connection can exist over the internet or a LAN.
-   Cloud computing does not require end-user knowledge of the physical location and configuration of the system that delivers the services.

#### Cloud Types
##### Public Cloud
- A cloud that can be accessed by anyone. Cloud-based computing resources (such as platforms, applications, and storage) are made available to the general public by a cloud service provider. The service provider may or may not require a fee for using these resources. For example, Google provides many publicly accessible cloud applications, such as Gmail and Google Docs.

##### Private Cloud
A cloud that provides resources to a single organization. Access is granted to only the users within the organization. Private clouds can be hosted internally, but because of the expense and expertise required to do so, they are typically hosted externally by a third party.  
  
An organization commonly enters into an agreement with a cloud service provider, which provides secure access to cloud-based resources. The organization's data is kept separate and secure from any other organization using the same service provider.

##### Community Cloud
A cloud designed to be shared by several organizations. Access is granted only to the users within the organizations who are sharing the community cloud infrastructure. Community clouds can be hosted internally, with each organization sharing the cost of implementation and maintenance.  
  
Because of the expense and expertise required to implement a community cloud, they are commonly hosted externally by a third party.

##### Hybrid Cloud
A cloud that is a combination of public, private, and community cloud resources from different service providers. The goal behind a hybrid cloud is to expand the functionality of a given cloud service by integrating it with other cloud services.

### Cloud Computing Advantages
#### Shared Resources
Sharing resources, or resource pooling, allows providers to serve multiple clients and customers with provisional and scalable services. These services can be adjusted to each client's needs without any changes being apparent to the client or end-user.  
  
Through modern scalable systems involved in cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS), providers can create a sense of infinite or immediately available resources by controlling resource adjustments at a meta-level. This allows customers to change their levels of service without being subject to any of the limitations of physical or virtual resources.

#### Metered utilization
_Pay and use_ computing power uses on-demand computing (ODC) or metering of services. ODC allows resources to be provided on an as needed and when needed basis.

#### Rapid Elasticity
_Rapid elasticity_ is the ability to provide scalable services. In other words, rapid elasticity allows users to automatically request additional space in the cloud or other types of services.

#### High Availability
- Cloud computing allows organizations to access the resources they need anytime, anywhere, and on any device. Self-service options make it so that you no longer need to wait for someone else to get you access to resources.

#### File Sync
- Cloud computing allows for file synchronization across an organization. When one user makes changes to a file, those changes can automatically be synced with the files of other users. This is particularly helpful for employees who work from home or for organizations with multiple geographic locations.

### Cloud Computing Service Models
Cloud computing service providers reduce the risk of security breaches in multiple ways. They:
-   Authenticate all users who access the service and allow users to access only the applications and data that they need.
-   Segregate each organization's centrally stored data.
-   Verify, test, and apply updates to the infrastructure.
-   Establish a formal process for all facets of the service, from user requests to major data breaches and catastrophic events.
-   Implement security monitoring of things like usage and unusual behavior.
-   Implement encryption up to the point of use, such as the client's web browser.
-   Probe for security holes with a third-party service provider.
-   Comply with all regulatory measures, like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

#### Model Types
##### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- IaaS delivers infrastructure (such as processing, storage, networks, and virtual environments) to the client. The client deploys and runs software without purchasing servers, data center space, or network equipment.

##### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- PaaS delivers everything a developer needs to build an application. The deployment comes without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers.

##### Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS delivers software applications to the client either over the internet or on a local area network. SaaS can be:

-   A simple multi-tenancy implementation in which customers have their own resources that are segregated from other customers.
-   A fine grain multi-tenancy implementation in which resources are shared, but data is segregated from other customers.
