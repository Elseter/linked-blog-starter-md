# 11.7 - Subnet to Meet Requirements
---
## Subnet Private versus Public IPv4 Address Space
- Enterprise networks will have an:
	- Intranet - A company's internal network typically using private IPv4 addresses
	- DMZ - A companies internet facing servers. Devices in the DMZ use public IPv4 addresses
		- Assumption that devices within the DMZ are compromised

	- A company could use the 10.0.0.0/8 and subnet on the /16 or /24 network boundary
	- The DMZ devices would have to be configured with public IP addresses

### Minimize Unused Host IPv4 Addresses and Maximize Subnets
- There are two considerations when planning subnets:
	- The number of host addresses required for each network
	- The number of individual subnets needed

#### Example: Efficient IPv4 Subnetting
- In this example, corporate headquarters has been allocated a public network address of 172.16.0.0/22 (10 host bits) by its ISP providing 1,022 host addresses
- There are five sites and therefore five internet connections which means the organization requires 10 subnets with the largest subnet requires 40 addresses
- IT allocated 10 subnets with a /26 subnet mask
