# 11.3 - Types of IPv4 Addresses
---
## Public and Private IPv4 Addresses
- As defined in RFC 1918, public IPv4 addresses are globally routed between internet service providers (ISP) routers
- Private addresses are common blocks of addresses used by most organizations to assign IPv4 addresses to internal host
- Private IPv4 addresses are not unique and can be used internally within any network
- However, private addresses are not globally routable

### Routing the Internet
- Network Address Translation (NAT) translates private IPv4 addresses to public IPv4 addresses
	- NAT is typically enabled on the edge router connecting to the internet 
	- It translates the internal private address to a public global IP address
	- 2 Components 
		- SNAT
		- PAT
			- relates your internal IP addresses to your single external IP address

### Special Use of IPv4 Addresses
**Loopback addresses**
- 127.0.0.0/8 
- Commonly identified as only 127.0.0.1
- Used on a host to test if TCP/IP is operational

**Link-Local addresses**
- 169.254.0.0/16 (169.254.0.1 - 169.254.255.254)
- Commonly known as the Automatic Private IP addressing (APIPA) addresses or self-assigned addresses
- Used by Windows DHCP clients to self-configure when no DHCP servers are aviable

### Legacy Classful Addressing
- RFC 790 (1981) allocated IPv4 addresses in classes
	- Class A (0.0.0.0/8 - 127.0.0.0/8)
	- Class B (128.0.0.0/16 - 191.255.0.0 /16)
	- Class C (192.0.0.0/24 - 223.255.255.0 /24)
	- Class D (224.0.0.0 - 239.0.0.0)
	- Class E (240.0.0.0 - 255.0.0.0)

- Classful addressing wasted many IPv4 addresses
- Classful address allocation was replaced with classless addressing which ignores the rules of classes (A, B, C)

### Assignment of IP Addresses
- The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) manages and allocates blocks of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to five Regional Internet Registries (RIR)
	- RIRs are responsible for allocating IP addresses to ISPs who provide IPv4 address blocks to smaller ISP organizations
