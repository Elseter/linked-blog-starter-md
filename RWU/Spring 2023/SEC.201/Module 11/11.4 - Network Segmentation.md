# 11.4 - Network Segmentation
---
## Broadcast Domains and Segmentation
- Many protocols use broadcasts or multicasts (e.g., ARP use broadcasts to locate other devices, hosts send DHCP discover broadcasts to locate a DHCP server)
- Switches propagate broadcasts out all interfaces except the interface on which it was received
	- The only device that stops broadcasts is a router
	- Routers do not propagate broadcasts
	- **Each router interface connects to a broadcast domain and broadcasts are only propagated within that specific broadcast domain**

### Problems with Large Broadcast Domains 
- A problem with large broadcast domain is that these hosts can generate excessive broadcasts and negatively affect the network
- The solution is to reduce the size of the network to create smaller broadcast domains in a process called subnetting
- EXAMPLE
	- Dividing the network address 172.16.0.0 /16 into two subnets of 200 users each 172.16.0.0 /24 and 172.16.1.0 /24
	- Broadcasts are only propagated within the smaller broadcast domains

### Reasons for Segmenting Networks
- Subnetting reduces overall network traffic and improves network performance
- It can be used to implement security policies between subnets
- Subnetting reduces the number of devices affected by abnormal broadcast traffic
- Subnets are used for a variety of reasons including:
	- Location
	- Group or Function
	- Device Type
