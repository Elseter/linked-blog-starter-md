# 11.8 - VLSM
---
## IPv4 Address Conservation
- Given the topology, 7 subnets are required (i.e four LANs and three WAN links) and the largest number of host is in building D with 28 hosts
- A /27 mask would provide 8 subnets with 30 host IP addresses and therefore support this topology

- However, the point-to-point WAN links only require two addresses and therefore waste 28  each for a total of 84 unused addresses
- Applying a traditional subnetting scheme to this scenario is not very efficient and is wasteful
- VSLM was developed to avoid wasting addresses by enabling us to subnet a subnet

## VLSM
- The left side displays the traditional subnetting scheme (i.e. the same subnet mask) while the right side illustrates how VLSM can be used to subnet a subnet and divided the last subnet into eight /30 subnets
- When using VLSM, always begin by satisfying the host requirements of the largest subnet and continue subnetting until the host requirements of the smallest subnets are satisfied
- The resulting topology with VLSM applied

### VLSM Topology Address Assignment
- Using VLSM subnets, the LAN and inter-router networks can be addressed without unnecessary waste as shown in the logical topology diagram
