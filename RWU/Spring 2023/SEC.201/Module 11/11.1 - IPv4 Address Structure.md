# 11.1 - IPv4 Address Structure
---
## Network and Host Portions
- An IPv4 address is a 32-bit hierarchical address that is made up of a network portion and a host portion
- when determining the network portion versus the host portion, you must look at the 32-bit stream
- A subnet mask is used to determine the network and host portions

## The Subnet Mask
- To identify the network and host portions of an IPv4 address, the subnet mask is compared to the IPv4 address bit for bit, from left to right
- The actual process used to identify the network and host portions is called ANDing

### The Prefix length
- A prefix length is a less cumbersome method used to identify a subnet mask address
- The prefix length is the number of bits set in 1 in the subnet mask
- It is written in "slash notation" therefore, count the number of bits in the subnet mask and prepend it with a slash
- IE /8, /16, /24

### Determining the Network: Logical AND
- A logical AND Boolean operation is used in determining the network address
	- Logical AND is the comparison of two bits where only a 1 and 1 produces a 1 and any other combination results in a 0
	- 1 = True, 0 = False
- To identify the network address, the host IPv4 address is logical ANDed, bit by bit, with the subnet mask to identify the network address

### Network, Host, and Broadcast Addresses
- Within each network are three types of IP addresses:
	- Network address
	- Host addresses
	- Broadcast addresses
