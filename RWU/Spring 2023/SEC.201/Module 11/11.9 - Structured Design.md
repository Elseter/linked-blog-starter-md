## IPv4 Network Address Planning
- IP network planning is crucial to develop a scalable solution to an enterprise network
	- To develop an IPv4 network wide addressing scheme, you need to know 
		- how many subnets are needed
		- how many hosts a particular subnet requires
		- what devices are part of the subnet
		- which parts of your network use private addresses
		- which use public
		- and many other determining factors

- Examine the needs of an organization's network usage and how the subnets will be structured
	- Perform a network requirement study by looking at the entire network to determining how each area will be segmented
	- Determine how many subnets are needed and how many hosts per subnet
	- Determine DHCP address pools and Layer 2 VLAN pools

### Device Address Assignment
- Within a network, there are different types of devices that require addresses:
	- **End user clients** - Most use DHCP to reduce errors and burden on network support staff. IPv6 clients can obtain address information using DHCPv6 or SLAAC
	- **Servers and peripherals** - These should have a predictable static IP address
	- **Servers that are accessible from the internet** - Servers must have a public IPv4 address, most often accessed using NAT
	- **Intermediary devices** - Devices are assigned addresses for network management, monitoring, and security
	- **Gateway** - Routers and firewall devices are gateway for the hosts in that network

- When developing an IP addressing scheme, it is generally recommended that you have a set pattern of how addresses are allocated to each type of device
