# 11.5 - Subnet an IPv4 Network
---
## Subnet on an Octet Boundary
- Networks are most easily subnetted at the octet boundary of /8, /16, and /24
- Notice that using longer prefix lengths decreases the number of hosts per subnet

- In the first table 10.0.0.0 /8 is subnetted using /16 and in the second table, a /24 mask
