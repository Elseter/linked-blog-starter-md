# 11.6 - Subnet a Slash 16 and a Slash 8 Prefix
---
## Create Subnets with a Slash 16 Prefix
- The table highlights all the possible scenarios for subnetting a /16 prefix
![[subnet slah 16.png]]

### Create a 100 subnets with a slash 16 prefix
- Consider a large enterprise that requires at least 100 subnets and has chosen the private address 172.16.0.0/16 as its internal network address
- The figure displays the number of subnets that can be created when borrowing bits from the third and fourth octet
	- Notice there are now up to 14 host bits that can be borrowed (last two bits can not be borrowed)
- To satisfy the requirement of 100 subnets for the enterprise, 7 bits (ie $2^7$ = 128 subnets) would need to be borrowed (for a total of 128 subnets)

### Create 1000 Subnets with a Slash 8 prefix
- Consider a small ISP that requires 1000 subnets for its clients using network address 10.0.0.0/8 which means there are 8 bits in the network portion and 24 host bits available to borrow toward subnetting
	- The figure displays the number of subnets that can be created when borrowing bits from the second and third
	- Notice there are now up to 22 host bits that can be borrowed (last 2 bits can not be borrowed)
- To satisfy the requirement of 1000 subnets for the enterprise, 10 bits (ie $2^{10}$ = 1024 subnets) would be needed to be borrowed
