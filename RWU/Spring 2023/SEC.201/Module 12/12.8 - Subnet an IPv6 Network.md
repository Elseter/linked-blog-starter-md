# 12.8 - Subnet an IPv6 Network
---
## Subnet using the Subnet ID
- IPv6 was designed with subnetting in mind
	- A separate subnet ID field in the IPv6 GUA is used to create subnets
	- The Subnet ID field is the area between the Global Routing Prefix and the Interface ID

### Subnetting Example
- Given the 2001:db8:acad::/48 global routing prefix with a 16 bit subnet ID
	- This allows for 65,536 /64 subnets
	- The global routing prefix is the same for all subnets
	- Only the subnet ID hextet is incremented in hexadecimal for each subnet

## Subnet Allocation
- The example topology requires five subnets, one for each LAN as well as one for the serial link
- The five IPv6 subnets were allocated with the subnet ID field 0001 through 0005. Each /64 subnet will provide more addresses than will ever be needed
