# 12.5 - Dynamic Addressing for IPv6 GUAs
---
## RS and RA Messages
- Devices obtain GUA addresses dynamically through Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) messages
	- Router Solicitation (RS) messages are sent by host devices to discover IPv6 routers
	- Router Advertisement (RA) messages are sent by routers to inform hosts on how to obtain an IPv6 GUA and provide useful network info such as:
		- Network prefix and prefix length
		- Default gateway address
		- DNS addresses and domain name
	- The TA can provide three methods for configuring an IPv6 GUA:
		- SLAAC
		- SLAAC with stateless DHCPv6 server
		- Stateful DHCPv6 (no SLAAC)

### Method 1: SLAAC
- SLAAC allows a device to configure a GUA without the services of DHCPv6
- Devices obtain the necessary information to configure a GUA from the ICMPv6 RA messages of the local router
- The prefix is provided by the RA and the device uses either the EUI-64 or random generation method to create an interface ID

### Method 2: SLAAC and Stateless DHCP
- SLAAC allows a device to use both SLAAC and stateless DHCPv6
- The RA message suggests devices use the following:
	- SLAAC to create its own IPv6 GUA
	- The router LLA, which is the RA source IPv6 address, as the default gateway address
	- A stateless DHCPv6 server to obtain other information such as DNS server address and a domain domain name

### Method 3: Stateful DHCPv6
- An RA can instruct a device to use stateful DHCPv6 only
- Stateful DHCPv6 is similar to DHCP for IPv4. A device can automatically receive a GUA, prefix length, and the addresses of DNS servers from a stateful DHCPv6 server
- The RA message suggests devices use the following:
	- The router LLA, which is the RA source IPv6 address, for the default gateway address
	- A stateful DHCPv6 server to obtain a GUA, DNS server address, domain name  and other necessary information

#### EUI-64 Process Vs. Randomly Generated
- When the RA message is either SLAAC or SLAAC with stateless DHCPv6, the client must generate its own interface ID
- The interface ID can be created using the EUI-64 process or a randomly generated 64-bit number

##### EUI-64 Process
- The IEEE defined the Extended Unique Identifier (EUI) or modified EUI-64 process which performs the following:
	- A 16 bit value of fffe (in hexadecimal) is inserted into the middle of the 48-bit Ethernet MAC address of the client
	- The 7th bit of the client MAC address is reversed from binary 0 to 1

##### Randomly Generated Interface IDs
- Depending upon the operating system, a device may use a randomly generated interface IS instead of using the MAC address and EUI-64 process
- Beginning with Windows Vista, Windows uses a randomly generated interface ID instead of the one created with EUI-64

>[! note] Note
>To ensure the uniqueness of any IPv6 unicast address, the client may use a process known as Duplicate Address Detection (DAD). This is similar to an ARP request for its own address. If there is no reply, then the address is unique
