# 12.3 - IPv6 Address Types
---
## Unicast, Multicast, Anycast
- There are three broad categories of IPv6 addresses:
	- **Unicast** - Unicast uniquely identifies an interface on an IPv6-enabled device
	- **Multicast** - Multicast is used to send a single IPv6 packet to multiple destinations
	- **Anycast** - This is any IPv6 unicast address that can be assigned to multiple devices. A packet sent to an anycast address is routed to the nearest device having that address

>[! note] Note
>Unlike IPv4, IPv6 does not have a broadcast address. However, there is an IPv6 all-nodes multicast address that essentially gives the same result.

### IPv6 Prefix Length
- Prefix length is represented in slash notation and is used to indicate the network portion of an IPv6 address
- The IPv6 prefix length can range from 0 to 128. The recommended IPv6 prefix length for LANs and most other types of networks is /64

- **Note** - It is strongly recommended to use a 64-bit Interface ID for most networks. This is because stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) uses 64 bits for the Interface ID. It also makes subnetting easier to create and manage

### Types of IPv6 Unicast Addresses
- Unlike IPv4 devices that have only a single address, IPv6 addresses typically have two unicast addresses:
	- **Global Unicast Address (GUA)** - This is similar to a public IPv4 address. These are globally unique, internet-routable addresses
	- **Link-local Address (LLA)** - Required for every IPv6-enabled device and used to communicate with other devices on the same local link. LLAs are not routable and are confined to a single link

#### A Note about the Unique Local Address
- The Ipv6 unqiue local addresses (range fc00::/7 to fdff::/7) have some similarity to RFC 1918 private addresses for IPv4, but there are significant differences
	- Unique local addresses are used for local addressing within a site or between a limited number of sites
	- Unique local addresses can be used for devices that will never need to access another network
	- Unique local addresses are not globally routed or translated to a global IPv6 address

>[! note] Note
>Many sites use the private nature of RFC 1918 addresses to attempt to secure or hide their network from potential security risks. This was never the intended use of ULAs.

### IPv6 GUA
- IPv6 global unicast addresses (GUAs) are globally unique and routable on the IPv6 internet
	- Currently, only GUA with the fist three bits of 001 or 2000::/3 are being assigned
	- Currently available GUAs begin with a decimal 2 or a 3 (This is only 1/8th of the total available IPv6 address space)

#### IPv6 GUA Structure
- **Global Routing Prefix**
	- The global routing prefix is the prefix, or network, portion of the address that is assigned by the provider, such as an ISP, to a customer or site. The global routing prefix will vary depending on ISP policies
- **Subnet ID**
	- The Subnet ID field is the area between the Global Routing Prefix and the Interface ID. The Subnet ID is used by an organization to identify subnets within its site
- **Interface ID**
	- The IPv6 interface ID is equivalent to the host portion of an IPv4 address. It is strongly recommended that in most cases /64 subnets should be used, which creates a 64-bit interface ID

### IPv6 LLA
- An IPv6 link-local address (LLA) enables a device to communicate with other IPv6 enabled devices on the same link and only on that link (subnet)
	- Packets with a source or destination LLA cannot be routed
	- Every IPv6-enabled network interface must have an LLA
	- If an LLA is not configured manually on an interface, the device will automatically create one
	- IPv6 LLAs are in the fe80::/10 range
