# 12.6 - Dynamic Addressing for IPv6 LLAs
---
## Dynamic LLAs
- All IPv6 interfaces must have an IPv6 LLA
- Like IPv6 GUAs, LLAs can be configured dynamically
- The figure shows the LLA is dynamically created using the fe80::/10 prefix and the interface ID using the EUI-64 process, or a randomly generated 64-bit number

### Dynamic LLAs on Windows
- Operating systems, such as Windows, will typically use the same method for both a SLAAC created GUA and a dynamically assigned LLA

### Dynamic LLAs on Cisco Routers
- Cisco routers automatically create an IPv6 LLA whenever a GUA is assigned to the interface. By default Cisco IOS routers use EUI-64 to generate the interface IS for all LLAs on IPv6 interface
