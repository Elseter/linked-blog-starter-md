# 12.4 - GUA and LLA Static Configuration
---
## Static GUA Configuration on a Router
- Most IPv6 comfiguration and verification commands in Cisco are similar to their IPv4 counterparts. In many cases, the only difference is the use of `ipv6` in the place of `ip` in the commands
	- The command to configure an IPv6 GUA on an interface is `ipv6 address` ipv6 address/prefix length
		- `interface g/0/0/0`
		- `ipv6 address 2001:db8:acad:1::1/64`
		- `no shutdown`

## Static GUA Configuration on a Windows Host
- Manually configuring the IPv6 address on a host is imilar to configuring an IPv4 address
- The GUA or LLA of the router interface can be used as the default gateway
	- Best practice is to use the LLA

>[! note] Note
>When DHCPv6 or SLAAC is used the LLA of the router will automatically be specified as the default gateway

### Static GUA Configuration of a Link-Local Unicast Address
- Configuring the LLA manually lets you create an address that is recognizable and easier to remember
	- LLAs can be configured manually using the `ipv6 address` ipv6-link-local-address `link-local` command

>[! note] Note
>The same LLA can be configured on each link as long as it is unique on that link. Common practice is to create a different LLA on each interface to a router to make it easy to identify the router and the specific interface
