# 12.1 - IPv4 Issues
---
## Need for IPv6 
- IPv4 has run out of addresses
- IPv6 is the successor to IPv4
- IPv6 has a much larger 128-bit address space 
- The development of IPv6 also included fixes for IPv4 Limitations and other enhancements

- With an increasing internet population, a limited IPv4 address space, issues with NAT and the IoT, the time has come to begin the transition to IPv6

### IPv4 and IPv6 Coexistence
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 coexist in the near future and the transition will take several years
- The IETF has created various protocols and tools to help network administrators migrate their networks to IPv6
	- These migration techniques can be divided into three categories
		- **Dual Stack** - The devices run both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks simultaneously
		- **Tunneling** - A method of transporting an IPv6 packet over an IPv4 network. The IPv6 packet in encapsulated inside an IPv4 packet
		- **Translation** - Network Address Translation 64 (NAT64) allows IPv6-enabled devices to communicate with IPv4-enabled devices using a translation technique similar to NAT for IPv4

>[! note] Note
>**Tunneling and translation are for transitioning to native IPv6 and should only be used where needed. The goal should be native IPv6 communications from source to destination.**
