# 12.7 - IPv6 Multicast Addresses
---
## Assigned IPv6 Multicast Addresses
- IPv6 multicast addresses have the prefix ff00::/8. There are two types of IPv6 multicast addresses:
	- **Well known multicast addresses**
	- **Solicited node multicast addresses**

- Multicast addresses can only be destination addresses and not source addresses

### Well-Known IPv6 Multicast Addresses
- Well known IPv6 multicast addresses are assigned and are reserved for predefined groups of devices
- There are two common IPv6 Assigned multicast groups
	- **ff02::1 All nodes multicast group** - This is a multicast group that all IPv6 enabled devices joining. A packet sent to this group is received and processed my all IPv6 interfaces on the link or network
	- **ff02::2 All routers multicast group** - This is a multicast group that all IPv6 routers join.  A router becomes a member of this group when it is enabled as an IPv6 router with the `ipv6 unicast-routing` global config command

### Solicited-Node Multicast
- A solicited-node multicast address is similar to the all-nodes multicast address
- A solicited-node multicast address is mapped to a special Ethernet multicast address
- The Ethernet NIC can filter the frame by examining the destination MAC address without sending it to the IPV6 process to see if the devices is the intended target of the IPv6 packet
