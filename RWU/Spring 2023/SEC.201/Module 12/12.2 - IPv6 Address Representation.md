# 12.2 - IPv6 Address Representation
---
## IPv6 Addressing Formats
- IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and written in hexadecimal
- IPv6 addresses are not case-sensitive and can be written in either lowercase or uppercase
- The preferred format for writing an IPv6 address is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x, with each "x" consisting of four hexadecimal values
- In IPv6, a hextet is the unofficial term used to refer to a segment of 16 bits, or four hexadecimal values
	- Examples of IPv6 addresses in the preferred format:
		- **2001:0db8:0000:1111:0000:0000:0000:0200**
		- **2001:0db8:0000:00a3:abcd:0000:0000:1234**

### Rule 1 - Omit Leading Zero
- The first rule to help reduce the notation of IPv6 addresses is to omit any leading 0s 
	- Examples:
		- 01ab can be represented as 1ab
		- 09f0 can be represented as 9f0
		- 0a00 can be represented as a00
		- 00ab can be represented as ab

>[! note] Note
>Only applies to LEADING zeros not to trailing zeros

### Rule 2 - Double Colon
- A double colon (::) can replace any single, contiguous string of one or more 16-bit hextets consisting of all zeros
	- Example:
		- 2001:db8:cafe:1:0:0:0:1 (leading 0s omitted) could be represented as 2001:db8:cafe:1::1

>[! note] Note
>The double colon (::) can only be used once within an address, otherwise there would be more than one possible resulting address
