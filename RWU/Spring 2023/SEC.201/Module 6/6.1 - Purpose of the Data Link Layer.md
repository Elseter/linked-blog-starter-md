# 6.1 - Purpose of the Data Link Layer
---
- The data link layer is the second layer of the OSI model
- Layer 2 uses layer 3 components like IP
## The Data Link layer
- The data link layer is responsible fro communications between end-devices network interface cards
- It allows upper layer protocols to access the physical layer media and encapsulates layer 3 packets (IPv4 and IPv6) into Layer 2 Frames
- It also preforms error detection and rejects corrupt frames
- Local transactions on the local area network

### IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Data Link Sublayers
- IEEE 802 LAN/WAN standards are specific to the type of network (Ethernet, WLAN, WPAN...)
- The Data Link Layer consists of two sublayers
	- **Logical Link Control (LLC)**
		- The LLC sublayer communicates between the networking software at the upper layers and the device hardware at the lower layers
	- **Media Access Control (MAC)**
		- The MAC sublayer is responsible for data encapsulation and media access control

### Providing Access to Media
- Packets exchanged between nodes may experience numerous data link layers and media transitions
- At each hope along the path, a router **preforms 4 basic Layer 2 functions**
	1. Accepts a frame from the network medium
	2. De-encapsulates the frame to expose the encapsulated packet
	3. Re-encapsulates the packet into a new frame
	4. Forwards the new frame on the medium of the next network segment

## Data Link Layer Standards
- Data link layer protocols are defined by engineering organizations
	- Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)
	- International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
	- International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
	- American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
