# 6.3 - Data Link Frame
---
### The Frame
- Data is encapsulated by the data link layer with a header and a trailer to form a frame
- A data link frame has three parts:
	- Header
	- Data
	- Trailer
- The fields of the header and trailer vary according to data link layer protocol

The amount of control information carried within the frame varies according to access control information and logical topology

#### Frame Fields

| Field                | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Frame Start and Stop | Identifies and end of frame               |
| Addressing           | Indicates source and destination nodes    |
| Type                 | Identifies encapsulated Layer 3 protocols |
| Control              | Identifies flow control services          |
| Data                 | Contains the frame payload                |
| Error Detection      | Used for determine transmission errors    |

#### Layer 2 Addresses
- Usually referred to as a physical address
	- MAC address
- Contained in the frame header
- Used only for local delivery of a frame on the link
- Updated by each device that forwards the frame

#### LAN and WAN Frames
- The logical topology and physical media determine the data link protocol used:
	- Ethernet
	- 802.11 Wireless
	- Point-to-Point (PTP)
	- High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC)
	- Frame-Relay
