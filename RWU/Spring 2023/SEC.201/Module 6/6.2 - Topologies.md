# 6.2 - Topologies
---
## Physical and Logical Topologies
The topology of a network is the arrangement and relationship of the network devices and the interconnections between them
- There are two types of topologies
	- **Physical topologies**
		- Shows physical connections and how devices are connected
	- **Logical topology**
		- Identifies the virtual connection between devices using device interfaces and IP addressing schemes

### WAN Topologies
- These are the most common
- There are three common physical WAN topologies
	- **Point-to-point**
		- the simplest and most common WAN topology. Consists of a permanent link between two endpoints
	- **Hub and Spoke**
		- sometimes called star
		- similar to a star topology where a central site interconnects branch sites through point-to-point links
		- puts people on separate sub-networks
	- **Mesh**
		- provides high availability but requires every end system to be connected to every other end system
		- high performance at the cost of security 

#### Point-to-Point WAN Topology 
- Physical point-to-point topologies directly connect two nodes
- The nodes may not share media with other hosts
- Because all frames on the media can only travel to or from the two nodes, Point-to-Point protocols can be very simple

#### LAN Topologies
- End devices on LANs are typically interconnected using a star or extended star topology. Star and extended star topologies are easy to install, very scalable and easy to troubleshoot
- Early Ethernet and Legacy Token Ring technologies provide two additional topologies
	- **Bus**
		- All end systems chained together and terminated on each end
	- **Ring**
		- Each end system is connected to its perspective neighbors to form a ring

#### Half and Full Duplex Communication
**Half-duplex communication**
- Only allows one device to send or receive at a time on a shared medium
- Used on WLANs and legacy bus topologies with Ethernet hubs
**Full-duplex communication**
- Allows both devices to simultaneously transmit and receive on a shared medium
- Ethernet switches operate in full-duplex mode

#### Access Control Methods
**Contention-based access**
- All nodes operating in half-duplex, competing for use of the medium. Examples are:
	- Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) as used on legacy bus-topology Ethernet

**Controlled access**
- Deterministic access where each node has its own time on the medium
- Used on legacy networks such as Token Ring and ARCNET

##### Contention-Based Access - CSMA/CD
**CSMA/CD**
- Used by legacy Ethernet LANs
- Operates in half-duplex mode where only one device sends or receives at a time
- Uses a collision detection process to govern when a device can send and what happens if multiple devices send at the time
**CSMA/CD collision detection process**
- Devices transmitting simultaneously will result in a signal collision on the shared media
- Devices detect the collision
- Devices wait a random period of time and retransmit data

###### CSMA/CA
**CSMA/CA**
- Used by IEEE 802.11 WLANs
- Operates in half-duplex mode where only one device sends or receives at a time
- Uses a collision avoidance process to govern when a device can send and what happens if multiple devices send at the same time

**CSMA/CA collision avoidance process**
- When transmitting, devices also include the time duration needed for the transmission
- Other devices on the shared medium receive the time duration information and know how long the medium will be unavailable
