- Hexadecimal is base 16
	- Using 0-9 and letters A-F
- It is easier to express a value as a single hexadecimal digit than as 4 binary bit
- Hexadecimal is used to represent IPv6 address and MAC addresses

- IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length. Each 4 bits is represented by a single hex digit
	- total length of 32 hex values
