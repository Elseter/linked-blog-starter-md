# 5.1 - Binary Number System
---
## Binary Numbers
- Current computing is based on switches, which typically have two options, on and off, which can be indicated by a bit (either 0 or 1)
### Binary and IPv4 Addresses
- Binary numbering system consists of 1s and 0s called bits
- Decimal numbering system consists of 0 through 9
- Hosts, servers, and network equipment use binary addressing to identify each other
- Each address is made up of a string of 32 bits, divided into 4 sections called octets
- Each octet contains 8 bits (or 1 byte) separated by a dot
	- 8 bits can represent 255 things
- For ease of use by people, this dotted notation is converted to dotted decimal

### Binary Positional Notation
- Positional notation means that digit represent different values depending on the position the digit occupies in the sequence of numbers
- The decimal positional notation system operates in magnitudes of 10
	- In binary, the positional notation system operates in magnitudes of 2
	- $2^0$, $2^1$, $2^2$, $2^3$ ... cont

### Decimal to Binary Conversion
- Start with the largest power of 2 that is smaller than the value you have been provided in decimal, then subtract that power of 2 from the decimal. 
	- Then subtract the next biggest power of 2
	- place 1s in place of the powers of 2 that can be subtracted
	- place 0 in place of the powers of 2 that were not subtracted

### IPv4 Addresses
- Routers and computers only understand binary, while humans work in decimal. It is important to understand these two numbering systems and how they are used in networking
