# 15.1 - Application, Presentation, and Session
---
## Application layer
- The upper three layers of the OSI model (application, presentation, and session) define the functions of the TCP/IP layer
- The application layer provides the interface between the application used to communicate, and the underlying network over which messages are transmitted
- Some of the most widely known application layer protocols are HTTP, FTP, TFTP, IMAP, and DNS

## Presentation and Session Layer
- The presentation layer has three primary functions
	- Formatting, or presenting, data at the source device into a compatible format for receipt by the destination device
	- Compressing data in a way that can be decompressed by the destination device
	- Encrypting data for transmission and decrypting upon receipt 

- The session layer functions
	- It creates and maintains dialogs between source and destination applications
	- It handles the exchange of information to initiate dialog, keep them active, and to restart session that are disrupted or idle for a long period of time

### TCP/IP Application Layer Protocols
- The TCP/IP application protocols specify the format and control necessary for many common internet communication functions
- Application layer protocols are used by both the source and destination devices during a communication session
- For the communications to be successful, the application layer protocols that are implemented on the source and destination host must be compatible

- Name System
	- DNS - Domain Name System
		- TCP, UDP client 53
		- Translates domain names such as cisco into ip addresses

- Host Config
	- DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
		- UDP client 68, server 67 
		- Dynamically assigns IP addresses to be re-used when no longer needed

- Web
	- HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
		- TCP 80, 8080
		- A set of rules for exchanging text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files on the World Wide Web
