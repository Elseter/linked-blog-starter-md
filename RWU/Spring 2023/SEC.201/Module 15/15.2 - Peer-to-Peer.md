# 15.2 - Peer-to-Peer
---
## Client-Server Model
- Client and server processes are considered to be in the application layer
- In the client/server model, the device requesting the information is called a client and the device responding to the request is called a server
- Application layer protocols describe the format of the requests and responses between clients and servers

## Peer-to-Peer Networks
- In peer-to-peer (P2P) network, two or more computers are connected via a network and can share resources (such as printers and files) without having a dedicated server
- Every connected end device (known as a peer) can function as both a server and a client
- One computer might assume the role of server for one transaction while simultaneously serving as a client for another. The roles of client and server are set on a per request basis

### Peer-to-Peer Applications
- A P2P application allows a device to act as both a client and a server within the same communication
- Some P2P applications use a hybrid system where each peer accesses an index server to get the location of a resource stored on another peer

#### Common P2P Applications
- With P2P applications, each computer in the network that is running the application can act as a client or a server for the other computers in the network that are also running the application
- Common P2P networks include the following:
	- BitTorrent
	- Direct Connect
	- eDonkey
	- Freenet
