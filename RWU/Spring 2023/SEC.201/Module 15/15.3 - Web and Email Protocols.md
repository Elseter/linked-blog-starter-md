# 15.3 - Web and Email Protocols
---
## Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Hypertext Markup Language
- When a web browser or Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is typed into a web browser, the web browser establishes a connection to the web service. The web service is running on the server that is using the HTTP protocol
- To better understand how the web browser and web server interact, examine how a web page is opened in a browser

- Step 1:
	- The browser interprets the three parts of the URL
		- http (protocol or scheme)
		- www.cisco.com (The sever name)
		- index.html (the specific filename requested)

### HTTP and HTML Continued
- Step 2
	- The browser then checks with a name server (DNS) to convert the server name to a numeric IP address, which it uses to connect to the server
	- The client initiates an HTTP request to a server by sending a GET request to the server and asks for the index.html file

- Step 3
	- In response to the request the server sends the HTML code for this web page to the browser

- Step 4:
	- The browser deciphers the HTML code and formates the page for the browser window

## HTTP and HTTPS
- HTTP is a request/response protocol that specifies the message types used for that communication
- The three most common message types are GET, POST, and PUT
	- GET 
		- This is a client request for data
		- A client sends the GET message to the web server to request HTML pages
	- POST
		- This uploads data files to the web server, such as form data
	- PUT
		- This uploads resources or content to the web server, such as image

## Email Protocols 
- Email is a store-and-foreward method of sending, storing, and retrieving electronic messages across a network. 
- Email messages are stored in databases on mail servers
- Email clients communicate with mail servers to send and receive mail

- The email protocols used for operation are:
	- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
		- Used to send mail
	- Post Office Protocol (POP) and IMAP
		- Used for clients to receive mail

### SMTP, POP and IMAF
- When a client sends email, the client SMTP process connects with a server SMTP process on well-known port 25
- After the connection is made, the client attempts to send the email to the server across the connection
- When the server receives the message, it either places the message in a local account, if the recipient is local, or forwards the message to another mail server for delivery
- The destination email sever may not be online or may be busy. If so, SMTP spools messages to be sent at a later time

#### SMTP, POP, and IMAF
- POP is used by an application to retrieve mail from a mail server. When mail is downloaded from the server to the client using POP the messages are then deleted on the server
	- The server starts the POP service by passively listening on TCP port 110 for client connection requests
	- When a client wants to make use of the service, it sends a request to establish a TCP connection with the server
	- When the connection is established, the POP server sends a greeting
	- The client and POP server then exchange commands and responses until the connection is closed or aborted 

### IMAP
- IMAP is another protocol that describes a method to retrieve email messages
	- Unlike POP, when a user connects to an IMAP server, copies of the messages are downloaded to the clients application. The original messages are kept on the server until manually deleted
	- When a user decides to delete a message, the server synchronizes that action and deletes the message from the server
