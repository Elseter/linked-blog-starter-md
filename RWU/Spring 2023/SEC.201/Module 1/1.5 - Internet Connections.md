## Internet Connections
### Internet Access Technologies
- There are many wats to connect users and organizations to the internet:
	- Popular services for home users and small offices include broadband cable, broadband digital subscriber line (DSL), wireless WANs, and mobile services
		- DSL is almost never used in the modern day
	- Organizations need faster connection to support their needs
	- These services are most often provided by ISPs (Internet Service Providers) also known as SPs

### Home and small office internet connections
| Connection        | Description                                                                                                               |

| Cable             | Incredibly common. High bandwidth, always on, internet offered by cable television service providers                      |
| DSL               | High bandwidth, always on, internet connection that runs over a telephone line. Used because the lines were already there |
| Cellular          | Uses a cell phone network to connect to the network                                                                       |

### Businesses Internet Connections
- Corporate connections may require:
	- higher bandwidth
	- dedicated connections
	- managed services
| Type of Connections                | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dedicated Leased Line (T1, T2, T3) | These are reserved circuits within the service providers network that connect distant offices with private voice and/or data networking |
| Ethernet WAN                       | This extends LAN access tech into the WAN                                                                                               |

### The Converging Network
- Before converging networks, an organization would have been separately cabled for telephone, video and data
	- Each of these technologies would use a different set of rules and standards
	- Additionally, they would have used different technologies to carry the signal

- Converging data networks carry multiple services on one link including:
	- data
	- voice
	- video
- Converged networks can deliver data, voice, and video over the same network infrastructure
- The network infrastructure uses the same set of rules and standards
	- TCP/IP
