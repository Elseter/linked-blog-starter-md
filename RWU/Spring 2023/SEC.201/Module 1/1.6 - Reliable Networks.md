# 1.6 - Reliable Networks
---
## Network Architecture
- Network Architecture refers to the technologies that support the infrastructure that moves data across the network
- There are 4 underling basic characteristics that the underlying architectures need to address to meet user expectations
	- Fault Tolerance
	- Scalability
	- Quality of Service
	- Security

### Fault Tolerance
- A fault tolerant network limits the impact of a failure by limiting the number of affected devices.
	- Multiple paths are required for fault tolerance
- Reliable networks provide redundancy by implementing a packet switched network
	- Packet switching splits traffic into packet that are routed over a network
	- Each packet could theoretically take a different path to the destination 
>[! bug] Circuit-Switched
>**This is not possible with circuit-switched networks which establish dedicated circuits.**
- SLA service level agreement
	- You have a provider agreement that you will be back online within a certain time frame
>[! tip] Key Concept
>Pretty much limit the impact the impact of failure

### Scalability
- A scalable network can expand quickly and easily to support new users and applications without impacting the performance of services to existing users
	- Network designers follow accepted standards and protocols in order to make the networks scalable.

### Quality of Service (QoS)
- Voice and live video transmission require higher level expectations for those services being delivered 
- Problems with streaming can be caused when there is a higher demand for bandwidth than available - and QoS isn't configured
	- QoS is the primary mechanism used to ensure reliable delivery of content for all users
	- With QoS in place, the router can more easily manage the flow of data and voice traffic

### Network Security
Two main types of network security that must be addressed
- Network infrastructure security
	- physical security of network devices
	- preventing unauthorized access to the devices
- Information Security
	- Protection of the information or data transmitted over the network

Three Goals of network security ==(MEMORIZE THIS)== CIA Triade
- **Confidentiality**
	- only intended recipients can read the data
- **Integrity**
	- Assurance that the data has not been altered within transmission
- **Availability**
	- assurance of timely and reliable access to data for authorized users
