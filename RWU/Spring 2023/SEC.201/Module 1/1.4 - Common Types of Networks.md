### The internet
- The original internet was originally just one WAN
- The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected LANs and WANs
	- LANs are connected to each other using WANs
	- WANs may use copper wires, fiber optic cables, and wireless transmissions

- The internet is not owned by any individual or group. The following group were developed to help maintain structure on the internet 
	- IETF
	- ICANN 
	- IAB
- These three groups were set up by the government and telcos to help regulate
>[! tip] Professor Opinion
>The internet is owned by the backbone service providers. It is not open source to everyone, look at China as an example. They essentially have their own sectioned off version of the internet 
>- The illusion that the internet is a free space is a dillusion
