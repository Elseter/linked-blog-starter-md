# 1.1-1.2 - Networking Today Lecture
---
## Networks Affect our Lives
- Communication is incredibly important, In todays world through the use of networks, we are connected like never before
### No Boundaries
- The existence of networks promotes global communities
- Human Networks

## Network Components
### Host Roles
- Every computer on a network is called a host or end device
	- **==Servers==** are computers that provide information to end devices
		- Email servers
		- Web servers
		- file server
	- Clients are computers that send requests to the servers to retrieve information
		- web page from a web server
		- email from an email server
>[! def] daemon
>An application or a tool that listen for connections
---
>[! def] Client
>A machine that attempts to establish a connection

### Peer-to-Peer Network
- Not as common on the modern internet 
- It is possible to have a device be a client and server in a Peer-to-Peer Network. This type of network design is only recommended for very small networks
- DECENTRALIZED
| Advantages                                                     | Disadvantages                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Easy to set up                                                 | no centralized administration |
| Less complex                                                   | Not as Secure                 |
| Lower cost                                                     | Not scalable                  |
| Used for simple tasks: transferring files and sharing printers | Slower preformance            |

### End Devices
- also known as end point devices
- What we may call clients in these models
>[! def] End Device
>An end device is where a message originates from or where it is received. Data originates with an end device, flows through a network, and arrives at an end device

### Intermediary Network Devices
- these interconnect end devices. Examples include switches, wireless access points, routers and firewalls
- Management of data as it flows through a network is also the role of an intermediary device including:
	- Regenerate and retransmit data signals
	- Maintain information about what pathways exist on the network
	- Notify other devices of errors and communication failures
![[SEC.201 IND.jpg]]
	- Multilayer switches are almost always called Layer 3 Switches (L3 Switch)

### Network Media
- Communication across a network is carried through a medium which allows a message to travel from source to designation
| Media Types                                               | Description                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Metal wires within cables (Instructor calls copper)       | Uses electrical impulses                                         |
| Glass of plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable) | Uses pulses of light                                             |
| Wireless transmission (WIFI or RF)                        | Uses modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves |
