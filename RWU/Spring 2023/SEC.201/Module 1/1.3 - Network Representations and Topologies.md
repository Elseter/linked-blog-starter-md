# 1.3 - Network Representations and Topologies
---
## Network Representations
- Network diagrams, often called **topology diagrams**, use symbols to represent devices within the network
- Important Terms to Know
	- Network Interface Card (NIC)
		- Every device on a network must have a NIC 
		- can be anything from a chip on a motherboard, to a card, to a USB
	- Physical Ports
		- Where anything can be connected
	- Interface
		- Often, the terms port and interface are used interchangeably

- LAN media is copper cables
- We won't deal with WAN media very much

### Topology Diagrams
- 2 types of diagrams that companies have to maintain
	- Physical Topology diagrams
	- Logical Topology diagrams
>[! def] Physical Topology
>Physical Topology diagrams illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation
>- Very useful when you need it, but often boring otherwise
---
>[! def] Logical Topology 
>Logical topology diagrams illustrate devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of the network
>- contains the address of devices
>- much more difficult to maintain
