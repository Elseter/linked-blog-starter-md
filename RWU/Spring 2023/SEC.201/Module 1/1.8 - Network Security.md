# 1.8 - Network Security

## Security Threats
- Threat vectors/threat surface
	- Internal/external/cloud based
- Integral part of networking regardless of network size
- must take into account the environment while securing the data
	- but still allowing for the quality of service that is expected on the network

### External Threats
- Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses
- Spyware and Adware
- Zero-day attacks
	- patched zero-day attacks (aka one-day attacks)
- Threat actor attacks
- Denial of service attacks
- Data interception and theft
- Identity theft
- Ransomware attacks

### Internal Threats
- lost or stolen devices
- accidental misuse by employees
- malicious employees

>[! tip] Professor Tip
>The biggest threats often come from those who already have access to the network. Never disregard the threat posed by employees

## Security Solutions
- Solutions must be implemented in multiple layers using more than one security solution
- For home and small office:
	- Antivirus and antispyware software should be installed on end devices
	- Firewall filtering used to block unauthorized access to the network

### Larger Networks
- Additional security requirements
	- Dedicated firewall systems
	- Access control lists (ACL)
	- Intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
	- Virtual private networks (VPN)

- The study of network security starts with a clear understanding of the underlying switching and routing infrastructure
