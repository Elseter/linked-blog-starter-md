# 8.1 - Network Layer Characteristics
---
## The Network Layer
- Layer 3 of the OSI Model
- Provides services to allow for devices to exchange data
- IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) are the principle network layer communication protocols
- The network layer preforms four basic operations:
	- Addressing end devices
	- Encapsulation (Every Layer)
	- Routing
	- De-encapsulation

### IP Encapsulation
- IP encapsulates the transport layer segment
- IP can use either IPv4 or IPv6 packet and impact the layer 4 segment
- IP packet will be examined by all layer 3 devices as it traverses the network
- The IP addressing does NOT change from source to destination

#### Characteristics of IP
- IP is meant to have low overhead and may be described as:
	- Connectionless
	- Best Effort
	- Media Independent

##### Connectionless
- IP is Connectionless
	- IP does not establish a connection with the destination before sending the packet
	- There is not control information needed (synchronizations, acknowledgments)
	- The destination will receive the packet when it arrives, but not pre-notification are sent by IP
	- If there is a need of connection-oriented traffic, then another protocol will handle this (typically TCP at the transport layer)

##### Best Effort
- IP is Best Effort
	- IP will not guarantee delivery of the packet
	- IP has reduced overhead since these is no mechanism to resend data that is not received
	- IP does not expect acknowledgments
	- IP does not know if the other device is operational or if it received the packet

##### Media Independent
- IP is unreliable
	- It cannot manage or fix undelivered or corrupt packets
	- IP cannot retransmit after an error
	- IP cannot realign out of sequence packets
	- IP must rely on other protocols for these functions
- IP is media Independent
	- Ip does not concern itself with the type of frame required at the data link layer or the media type at the physical layer
	- IP can be sent over any media type: copper, fiber, or wireless

###### Media Independent cont.
- The network layer will establish the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
	- Network layer receives this from control information sent by the data link layer
	- The network then establishes the MTU size
- Fragmentation is when Layer 3 splits the IPv4 packet into smaller units
	- Fragmenting causes latency
	- IPv6 does not fragment packets
