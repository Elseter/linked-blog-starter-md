# 8.3 - IPv6 Packets
---
## Limitations of IPv4
- IPv4 has 3 major limitations
	- **IPv4 address depletion** - We have basically run out of IPv4 addressing
	- **Lack of end-to-end connectivity** - To make IPv4 survive this long, private addressing and NAT were created
	- **Increased network complexity** - NAT was meant as temporary solution and creates issues on the network as a side effect of manipulating the network headers addressing. NAT causes latency and troubleshooting issues.

## IPv6 Overview
- IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
- IPv6 overcomes the limitations of IPv4
- Improvements:
	- **Increased Address Size**
		- Based on 128 bit address not 32 bits
	- **Improved packet handling**
		- simplified header with fewer fields
	- **Eliminates the need for NAT**
		- since there is a huge amount of addressing, there is no need to use private addressing internally and be mapped to a shared public address

### IPv6 Packet Headers
- The IPv6 header is simplified, but not smaller
- The header is fixed at 40 bytes or octets long
- Several IPv4 fields were removed to improve performance
	- Flag
	- Fragment Offset
	- Header Checksum

| Function                 | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Version                  | This will be for v6, as opposed to v4, a 4 bit field = 0110                   |
| Traffic Class            | Used for QoS, Equivalent to DiffServ                                          |
| Flow Label               | Informs the device to handle identical flow labels the same way, 20 bit field |
| Payload Length           | This 16-bit field indicates the length of the data portion or payload         |
| Next Header              | I.D.s next level protocol: ICMP, TCP, UDP...                                  |
| Hop Limit                | Replaces TTL field Layer 3 hop count                                          |
| Source IPv4 Address      | 128 bit source address                                                        |
| Destination IPv4 Address | 128 bit source address                                                                              |

- IPv6 packet may also contain extension headers (EH)
- EH headers characteristics
	- provide optional network layer information
	- are optional
	- are placed between IPv6 header and payload
	- may be used for fragmentation, security, mobility support , etc

- Unlike IPv4, routers do not fragment IPv6 packets
