# 8.4 - How a Host Routes
---
- Routing is the essence of Layer 3
## Host Forwarding Decision
- Packets are always created at the source
- Each host devices creates their own routing table
- A host can send packets to the following
	- Itself - 127.0.0.1 (IPv4), ::1 (IPv6)
		- loopback address / home
	- Local Hosts - destination is on the same LAN
	- Remote Hosts - devices are not on the same LAN

### Host Forwarding Decision (Cont.)
- The source device determines whether the destination is local or remote
- Method of determination
	- IPv4 - Source uses its own IP address and Subnet mask, along with the destination IP address
	- IPv6 - Source uses the network address and prefix advertised by the local router
- local traffic is dumped out the host interface to be handled by an intermediary device
- Remote traffic is forwarded directly to the default gateway on the LAN
	- if no default gateway, traffic is dropped
	- stub is used to describe networks with only 1 layer 3 device
		- Only attached to public at 1 point
		- This point can be called border or edge

### Default Gateway
- A router or layer 3 switch can be a default gateway
- Features of a default gateway (DGW):
	- It must have an IP address in the same range as the rest of the LAN
	- It can accept data from the LAN and is capable of forwarding traffic off of the LAN
	- It can route to other networks
- If a device has no default gateway or a bad default gateway, its traffic will not e able to leave the LAN

### A host routes to the default gateway
- The host will know the default gateway (DGW) either statically or through DHCP in IPv4
- IPv6 sends the DGW through a router solicitation (RS) or can be configured manually
- A DGW is a static route which will be a last resort route in the routing table
- All devices on the LAN will need the DGW of the router if they intend to send traffic remotely 

### Host Routing Tables
- On Windows, route print or netstat -r to display the PC routing table
- Three section displayed by these two commands
	- Interface List - all potential interfaces and MAC addressing
	- IPv4 Routing Table
	- IPv6 Routing Table
