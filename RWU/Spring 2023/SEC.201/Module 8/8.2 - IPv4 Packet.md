## IPv4 Packets
### IPv4 Packet Header
- IPv4 is the primary communication protocol for the network layer
- The network header has many purposes:
	- It ensures the packet is sent in the correct direction
	- It contains information for network layer processing in various fields
	- The information contained in the header is used by all layer 3 devices that handle the packet

#### IPv4 Packet Header Fields
- The IPv4 network header characteristics
	- It is in binary
	- Contains several fields of information
	- Diagram is read from left to right, 4 bytes per line
	- The most important fields are the source and destination
- Protocols may have one or more functions

**Significant fields in the IPv4 header**
| Function                 | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Version                  | This will be for v4, as opposed to v6, a 4 bit field = 0100                     |
| Differentiated Services  | Used for QOS: DiffServ - DS field or the older IntServ - TOS or Type of Service |
| Header Checksum          | Detect corruption in the IPv4 Header                                            |
| Time to Live (TTL)       | Layer 3 hop count. When it becomes 0 the router will discard he packet          |
| Protocol                 | I.D.s next protocol: ICMP, TCP, UDP, ect                                        |
| Source IPv4 Address      | 32 bit source address                                                           |
| Destination IPv4 Address | 32 bit destination address                                                                                |
