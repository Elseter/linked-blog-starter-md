# 8.5 - Intro to Routing

## Router Packet Forwarding Decision
- What happens when the router receives the frame from the host device

## IP Router Routing Table
- There are three types of routes in a routers a routing table
	- **Directly Connected**
		- These routers are automatically added by the router, provided the interface is active and has addressing
	- **Remote**
		- There are the routes the router does not have a direct connection to and may have learned
			- Manually - with a static route
			- Dynamically - by using a router protocol to have routers share their information with each other
	- **Default Route**
		- This forwards all traffic to a specific direction when there is not a match in the routing table

### Static Routing
- Far less common than they used to be
- Characteristics
	- Must be manually configured
	- Must be adjusted manually by the administrator when there is a change in the topology
	- Good for small non-redundant networks
	- Often used in conjunction with a dynamic routing protocol for configuring a default route

### Dynamic Routing
- Dynamic Routes Automatically:
	- Discover remote networks
	- Maintain up-to-date information
	- Choose the best path to the destination
	- Find new best paths when there is a topology change
- Dynamic routing can also share static default routes with other routers

### Introduction to an IPv4 Routing Table
- Use `show ip route` command to show the following route sources
	- **L** - Directly connected local interface IP address
	- **C** - Directly connected network
	- **S** - Static route was manually configured by an admin
	- **O** - OSPF
		- type of routing protocol
	- **D** - EIGRP

- Directly connected - C and L
- Remote Routes - O, D, etc.
- Default routes - S*
