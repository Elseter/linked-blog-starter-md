## Physical Layer Standards
![[SEC.201 PLS.png]]

>[! tip] Doug Tip
>There are physical layer standards that are enforced by local law enforcement with different standards varying from state to state
>- building codes
>- FCC (Federal Communications Commitee)

## Physical Components
Physical Layer Standards address three functional areas:
- Physical Components
- Encoding 
- Signaling

The physical components are the hardware devices, media, and other connectors that transmit the signals that represent the bits
- Hardware components like NICs, interfaces and connectors, cable materials, and cable designs are all specified in standards associated with the physical layer

## Encoding
- Encoding converts the stream of bits into a format recognizable by the next device in the network path
- This `coding` provides predictable patterns that can be recognized by the next device
- Examples of encoding methods include Manchester, 4B/5B, and 8B/10B

## Signaling 
- The signaling method is how the bit values "1" and "0" are represented on the physical medium
- The method of signaling will vary based on the type of medium being used

## Bandwidth
- Bandwidth is the capacity at which a medium can carry data
- Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time; how many bits can be transmitted in a second
- Physical media properties, current technologies, and the laws of physics play a role in determining available bandwidth
| Unit of Bandwidth   | Abbreviation | Equivalence                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Bits per second     | bps          | 1 bps = fundamental unit of bandwidth        |
| Kilobits per second | Kbps         | 1 Kbps = 1,000 bps = $10^3$ bps              |
| Megabits per second | Mbps         | 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps = $10^6$ bps          |
| Gigabits per second | Gbps         | 1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bps = $10^9$ bps      |
| Terabits per second | Tbps         | 1 Tbps = 1,000,000,000,000 bps = $10^12$ bps |

### Bandwidth Terminology
**Latency**
- Amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another
**Throughput**
- The measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time
**Goodput**
- The measure of usable data transfer over a given period of time
- Goodput = Throughput - traffic overhead
