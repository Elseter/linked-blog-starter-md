# 4.5 - Fiber-Optic Cabling
---
## Properties of Fiber-Optic Cabling
- Not as common as UTP because of the expense involved
- Ideal for some networking scenarios
- Transmits data over longer distances at higher bandwidth than any other networking media
- Less susceptible to attenuation, and completely immune to EMI/RFI
- Made of flexible, extremely thin strands of very pure glass
- Uses a laser or LED to encode bits as pulses of light
- The fiber-optic cable acts as a wave guide to transmit light between the two ends with minimal signal loss

### Types of Fiber Media
**Single Mode Fiber**
![[SEC.201 single mode fiber.png]]
- small core
- expensive lasers
- long-distance applications

**Multimode Fiber**

- Larger Core
- Uses less expensive LEDs
- LEDs transmit at different angles
- Up to 10 Gbps over 550 meters

**Dispersion**
- refers to the spreading out of a light pulse over time
- Increased dispersion means increased loss of signal strength
- MMF has greater dispersion than SMF, with the maximum cable distance for MMF is 550 meters

### Fiber-Optic Cabling Usage
Fiber-optic cabling is now being used in 4 types of industry:
**Enterprise Networks:** 
- Used for backbone cabling applications and interconnecting infrastructure devices
**Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH):**
- Used to provide always on broadband services to home and small business
**Long-Haul Networks:**
- Used by service providers to connect countries and cities
**Submarine Cable Networks:**
- Used to provide reliable high-speed, high-capacity solutions capable of surviving in harsh undersea environments at up to transoceanic distances

This course will focus on the use of fiber in enterprise

### Fiber Optic Connectors
- Straight-Tip (ST) Connectors
- Lucent Connector (LC) Simplex Connectors
- Subscriber Connectors (SC) Connectors
- Duplex Multimode LC Connectors

### Fiber Patch Cords
- SC-SC MM Patch Cord
- LC-LC SM Patch Cord
- ST-LC MM Patch Cord
- ST-SC SM Patch Cord
![[SEC.201 Fiber Patch Cords.jpg]]
- Yellow is single-mode
- Orange (or aqua) is multi-mode

## Fiber versus Copper
Optical fiber is primarily used as backbone cabling for high-traffic, point-to-point, connections between data distribution facilities and for the interconnection of buildings in multi-building campuses
