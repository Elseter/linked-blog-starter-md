# 4.3 - Copper Cabling
---
## Characteristics of Copper Cabling
Copper cabling is the most common type of cabling used in networks today. It is inexpensive, easy to install, and has low resistance to electrical current flow
**Limitations**
- Attenuation: - the longer the electrical signals have to travel, the weaker they get
- The electrical signal is susceptible to interference from two sources, which can distort and corrupt the data signals (Electromagnetic Interference) EMI and (Radio Frequency Interference) RFI and Crosstalk
**Mitigation**
-  Strict adherence to cable length limits will mitigate attenuation
- Some kinds of copper cable mitigate EMI and RFI by using metallic shielding and grounding
- Some kinds of copper cable mitigate crosstalk by twisting opposing circuit pair wires together

## Types of Copper Cabling
- Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP) Cable
- Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP) Cable
- Coaxial Cable

### Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
- UTP is the most common networking media
- Terminated with RJ-45 connectors
- Interconnected hosts with intermediary network devices
- The more twists per meter, the higher the quality of signal
**Key Characteristics of UTP**
1. The outer jacket protects the copper wires from physical damage
2. Twisted pairs protect the signal from interference
3. Color coded plastic insulation electrically isolates the wires from each other and identifies each pair
4. **==4 pairs of wire==**

### Shielded Twisted Pair
- Better noise protection than UTP
- More expensive than UTP
- Harder to install than UTP
- Terminated with RJ-45 connectors
- Interconnects hosts with intermediary network devices
**Key Characteristics of STP**
1. The outer jacket protects the copper wires from physical damage
2. Braided or foil shield provides EMI/RFI protection
3. Foil shield for each pair of wires provides EMI/RFI protection
4. Color coded plastic insulation electrically isolates the wires from each other and identifies each pair
5. **==4 pairs of wire==**

### Coaxial Cable
Consists of the following:
1. Outer cable jacket to prevent minor physical damage
2. A woven copper braid, or metallic foil, acts as the second wire in the circuit and as a shield for the inner conductor 
3. A layer of flexible plastic insulation
4. A copper conductor is used to transmit the electrical signals 

There are different types of connectors with coax cable
Commonly used in the following situations
- Wireless installations - attach antennas to wireless devices
- Cable internet installations - customer premises wiring
