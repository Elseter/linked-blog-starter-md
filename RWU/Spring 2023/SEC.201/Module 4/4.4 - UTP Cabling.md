# 4.4 - UTP Cabling
---
## Properties of UTP Cabling
>[! tip] Doug Tip
>Much of what is said about UTP will apply to STP as well
>- REMEMBER 4 pairs
>- 8 wires

UTP has 4 pairs of color coded copper wires twisted together and encased in a flexible plastic sheath.
- No shielding is used
- UTP relies on the following properties to limit crosstalk
**Cancellation:**
- Each wire in a pair of wires uses opposite polarity. On wire is negative, the other wire is positive. They are twisted together and the magnetic fields effectively cancel each other and outside EMI/RFI
**Variation in twists per foot in each wire:** 
- Each wire is twisted a different amount, which helps prevent crosstalk amongst the wires in a cable

### UTP Cabling Standards and Connectors
Standards for UTP are established by the TIA/EIA
TIA/EIA-568 standardizes elements like:
- cable types
- cable lengths
- connectors
- cable termination
- testing methods

Electrical standards for copper cabling are established by the IEEE, which rates cable according to its performance
Examples include:
- Category 3
- Category 5 and 5e
- Category 6
	- Typically the higher the number, the higher the quality

| Cable Type                | Standard                       | Application                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ethernet Straight-Through | Both ends T568A or T568B       | Host to network Device                                              |
| Ethernet Crossover*        | One end T568A, other end T568B | Host to Host, Switch to Switch, Router to Router                    |
| Rollover                  | Cisco Proprietary              | Host serial port to Router or Switch console port, using an adapter |

>[! bug] Ethernet Crossover
>Considered Legacy due to most NICs using Auto-MDIX to sense cable type and complete connection
