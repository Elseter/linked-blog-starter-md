## Properties of Wireless Media
It carries electromagnetic signals representing binary digits using radio or microwave frequencies.
- This provides the greatest mobility option
- most rapidly growing

Some limitations
- **Coverage Area:** - Effective coverage can be significantly impacted by the physical characteristics of the deployment area
- **Interference:** - Wireless is susceptible to interference and can be disrupted by many common devices
- **Security:** - Wireless communication coverage requires no access to a physical strand of media, so anyone can gain access to the transmission
- **Shared Medium:** - WLANs operate in half-duplex, which means only one device can send or receive at a time. Many users accessing the WLAN at the same time results in reduced bandwidth for each user

## Types of Wireless Media
The IEEE and telecommunications industry standards for wireless data communications cover both the data link and physical layers. In each of these standards, physical specifications dictate:
- Data to radio signal encoding methods
- Frequency and power of transmission
- Signal reception and decoding requirements
- Antenna design and construction

**Wireless Standards:**
- **Wi-Fi** (IEEE 802.11) - Wireless LAN (WLAN) tech
- **Bluetooth** (IEEE 802.15) - Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) 
- **WiMAX** (IEEE 802.16) - Uses a point-to-multipoint topology to provide broadband wireless access
	- Never really took off in the US
- **Zigbee** (IEEE 802.15.4) - Low data-rate, low power consumption communications, primarily for the Internet of Things (loT) applications
	- First took off with lightbulbs

## Wireless LAN
In general, a Wireless LAN (WLAN) requires the following devices:
- **Wireless Access Point (WAP)** - Concentrate wireless signals from users and connect to existing copper-based network infrastructure
- **Wireless NIC Adapters** - Provide wireless communications capability to network hosts

There are a number of WLAN standards.
- Make sure to ensure compatibility and interoperability
- Network admins must develop and apply stringent security policies and processes to protect WLANs from unauthorized access and damage
