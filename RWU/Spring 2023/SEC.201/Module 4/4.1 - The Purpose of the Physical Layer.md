# 4.1 - The Purpose of the Physical Layer
---
## The Physical Connection
- Before any network communication can occur, a physical connection to a local network must be established
- This connection could be wired or wireless, depending on the setup of the network
- This general applies whether you are at a corporate office or at home
- A **Network Interface Card** (NIC) connects a device to the network
	- Some devices may have just one NIC, while others may have multiple NIC's (Wired and/or Wireless)
- Not all physical connections offer the same level of performance

>Components will go bad, you need to be prepared to replace components that fail with time

## The Physical Layer
- This layer transports bits across the network media
- It accepts a complete frame from the Data Link Layer and encodes it as a series of signals that are transmitted to the local media
- This is the last step of the encapsulation process
- The next device in the path to the destination receives the bits, and re-encapsulates the frame, then decides what to do with it

>Most important: transports bits across the network
