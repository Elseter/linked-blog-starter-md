# 9.1 - MAC and IP
---
## Destination on the Same Network
- There are two primary addresses assigned to a device on an Ethernet LAN
	- **Layer 2 physical address (the MAC address)**
		- Used for NIC to NIC communications on the same ethernet network
	- **Layer 3 logical address (the IP address)**
		- Used to send the packet from the source device to the destination device

- Layer 2 addresses are used to deliver frames from one NIC to another NIC on the same network. If a destination IP address is on the same network, the destination MAC address will be that of the destination device

## Destination on a Remote Network
- When the destination IP address is on a remote network, the destination MAC address is that of the default gateway
	- ARP is used by IPv4 to associate the IPv4 address of a device with the MAC address of the device NIC
	- ICMPv6 is used by IPv6 to associate the IPv6 address of a device with the MAC address of the device NIC
