# 2.6 - Ports and Addresses
---
## IP Addresses
- The use of IP addresses is the primary means of enabling devices to locate one another and establish end-to-end communication on the internet
- The Structure of IPv4 address is called dotted decimal notation and is represented by 4 decimal numbers between 0 and 255
- An IPv4 subnet mask is a 32 bit value that differentials the network portion of the address from the host portion
	- Coupled with the IPv4 address. the subnet mask determines to which subnet the device is a member
- The default gateway address is the IP address of the router that the host will use to access remote networks, including the internet
>[! tip] DOUG TIP
>You will need to know binary and the subnet mask for the cisco exam

## IP Addresses (Cont.)
- IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and written as a string of hexadecimals values.
	- Ever 4 bits is represented by a single hexadecimal digit
	- this results in 32 hexadecimal values
	- groups of four hexadecimal digits are separated by a colon `:`

- IPv6 address are not case-sensitive and can be written in either lowercase and uppercase

## Interfaces and Ports
- Network communication depend on end user device interfaces, networking device interfaces, and cables that connect them
- Types of network media include twisted-pair copper cables, fiber-optic cables, coaxial cables, or wireless

- Different types of network media have different features and benefits. Some of the differences include
	- Distance media can carry signal
	- Environment where media is to be installed
	- Amount of data and the speed at which it must be transmitted
	- cost of media and installation
