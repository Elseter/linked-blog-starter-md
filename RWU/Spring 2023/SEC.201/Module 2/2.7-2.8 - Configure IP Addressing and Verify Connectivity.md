# 2.7-2.8 - Configure IP Addressing and Verify Connectivity
---
## Manual IP Address Configuration for End Devices
- End devices on a network need an IP address in order to communicate with other devices on the network

- IPv4 address information can be entered into end devices manual or automatically using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
	- To manual config an IPv4 address on Windows
		- Open Control Panel > Network Sharing Center > Change adapter settings
		- Choose the adaptor
		- right click properties and display Local Area Connection properties
		- Next, click properties to open the Internet Protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4) properties window

## Automatic Address Configuration for End Devices
- DHCP enables automatic IPv4 address configuration for every end device that is DHCP-enabled
- End devices are typically by default using DHCP for automatic IPv4 configuration

- To config DHCP on windows
	- Follow the same instructions until selecting Internet Protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4) properties
	- then select obtain an IP address automatically and Obtain DNS server address automatically

## Switch Virtual Interface Configuration
- To access a switch remotely, an IP address and a subnet mask must be configured on the SVI
- To configure an SVI on a switch:
	- Enter the `interface vlan 1` command in global config mode
	- Next assign an IPv4 address using `ip address` ip-address subnet-mask command
	- Finally, enable the virtual interface using the `no-shutdown` command

>[! example]
>```
>Switch# configure terminal
>Switch(config)# interface vlan1
>Switch(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.20 255.255.255.0
>Switch(config-if)# no shutdown
>```

>[! tip] Doug Tip
>One of the most important Cisco interface commands to know is:
>```
>Switch# show ip interface brief
>```
- Once you change the IP address, it is changed permanently, reverting it can be very difficult
