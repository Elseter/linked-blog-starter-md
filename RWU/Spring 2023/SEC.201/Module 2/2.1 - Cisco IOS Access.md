## Operating Systems
**Shell**
- The user interface that allows users to request specific tasks from the computer
- These requests can be made either through the CLI (command line interface) or GUI (graphical user interface)
**Kernel**
- Communicates between the hardware and software of a computer and manages how hardware resources are used to meet software requirements
- collection of various layers
	- ring 2, ring 3
**Hardware**
- The physical part of a computer including underlying electronics

## GUI
- A GUI allows the user to interact with the system using an environment of graphical icons, menus and windows
	- more user friendly and requires less knowledge of underlying command structure that controls the system
	- Windows, macOS, Linux KDE, Apple IOS and Android

- GUI can fail, crash, or simply not operate as specified. 
	- most network devices are typically accessed through a CLI

## Purpose of an OS
- A PC operating system enables the user to do the following
	- use a mouse to make selections and run commands
	- enter text and text based commands

- A CLI-based network operating system enables a network technician to do the following
	- use a keyboard to run CLI-based network programs
	- use a keyboard to enter text and text-based commands
	- view output on a monitor

## Access Methods
**Console**
- a physical management port used to access a device in order to provide maintenance, such as preforming initial configurations 
	- RS-232 cable
	- baby clue console cables

**Secure Shell (SSH)**
- establishes a secure remote CLI connection to a device, through a virtual interface, over a network
	- This is the recommended method 
	- runs on port 22/TCP
	- free tool
		- putty 

**Telnet**
- establishes an insecure remote CLI connection to a device over a network
	- user authentication, passwords and commands are sent in plain text over the network

>[! tip] Doug Tip
>DO NOT USE TELNET. It is horribly insecure and likely has insulted doug's feelings at some point

## Terminal Emulation Programs
- used to connect to a network device by either a console port of by an SSH/Telnet connection
- There are several terminal emulation programs to chose from such as PuTTY, Tera Term and SecureCRT
