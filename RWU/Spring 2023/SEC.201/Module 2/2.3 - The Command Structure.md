**Keyword**
- This is specific parameter defined in the operating system
**Argument**
- This is not predefined; it is a value or variable defined by the user

- A command might require one or more arguments
	- Boldface text indicates commands and keywords that are entered as shown
	- Italic text indicates an argument where the user provides the value

>[! example]
>```
>traceroute ip-address
>```
- The command is **traceroute** and the use defined argument is the ip-address
- sends out ping with limited number of hops

## IOS Help Features
- The IOS has two forms of help available: context-sensitive help and command syntax check
**Context-sensitive**
- enables you to quickly find answers to these questions
	- which commands are available in each command mode
	- which commands start with specific characters or groups of characters
	- which arguments and keywords are available to particular commands

**Command syntax**
- verifies that a valid command was entered by the user
	- If the interpreter cannot understand the command being entered, it will provide feedback describing what is wrong with the command

## Hot Keys and Shortcuts
- The IOS CLI provides hot keys and shortcuts that make configuring, monitoring and troubleshooting easier
- Commands and keywords can be shortened to the minimum number of characters that identify a unique selection. For example, the `configure` command can be shortened to `conf` because `configure` is the only command begins with conf

- When more text is generated than can be displayed, the IOS will display the --more-- prompt
	- enter will display the next line
	- space bar will display the next screen
	- any other key will end the display string

- Ctrl-C
	- ends config mode and returns to privileged EXEC mode
- Ctrl-Z
	- ends config mode and returns to privileged EXEC mode
- Ctrl-Shift-6
	- All-purpose break sequence used to abort DNS lookups, traceroutes, pings, and ect
