# 7.1 - Ethernet Frames

## Ethernet Frames
### Ethernet Encapsulation
- Ethernet operates in the data link layer and the physical layer
- It is a family of networking technologies defined in the IEEE 802.2 and 802.3 standards

#### Data Link Sublayers
- The 802 LAN/MAN standards, including Ethernet, use two separate sublayers of the data link layer to operate
	- **LLC Sublayer:**
		- IEEE 802.2
		- Places information in the frame to identify which network layer protocol is used for the frame
	- **MAC Sublayer:**
		- IEEE 802.3, 802.11, or 802.15
		- Responsible for data encapsulation and media access control, and provides data link layer addressing

##### MAC Sublayer
- The MAC sublayer is responsible for data encapsulation and accessing the media
- **Data Encapsulation**
	- IEEE 802.3 data encapsulation includes the following
		- **Ethernet frame** - This is the internal structure of the Ethernet frame
		- **Ethernet addressing** - The Ethernet frame includes both a source and destination MAC address to deliver the frame from one NIC to another NIC on the same LAN
		- **Ethernet Error detection** - The Ethernet frame includes a frame check sequence (FCS) trailer used for error detection

###### More MAC Sublayer
- **Media Access**
	- The IEEE 802.3 MAC sublayer includes the specifications for different Ethernet communications standards over various types of media including copper and fiber
	- Legacy Ethernet using a bus topology or hubs, is a shared, half-duplex  medium
		- uses a contention-based access method, carrier sense multiple access/collision detection (CSMA/CD)
	- Ethernet LANs of today use switches that operate in full-duplex
		- these do not require access control through CSMA/CD

### Ethernet Frame Fields
- The minimum Ethernet frame size is 64 bytes and the maximum is 1518 bytes
	- the preamble is not included when describing the size of a frame

- Any frame less than 64 byes is considered a "collision fragment" or "runt frame" and is auto discarded
	- Any larger than 1500 bytes are considered "jumbo" or "baby giant frames"

- If the size of a frame is less than or greater than the size limit, the receiving device drops the frame
	- Dropped frames are likely the results of collisions or other unwanted signals. They are considered invalid
- Jumbo frames are usually supported by most fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet switches and NICs
