# 17.4 - Verify Connectivity
---
## Verify Connectivity with Ping
- Whether your network is small and new, or you are scaling an existing network, you will always wasn't to be able to verify that your components are properly connected to each other and to the internet
	- The ping command, available on most operating systems, is the most effective way to quickly test layer 3 connectivity between a source and destination IP address
	- The ping command uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo (ICMP Type 8) and echo reply (ICMP Type 0) messages

### Verify Connectivity with Ping
- On windows 10 host, the ping command sends four consecutive ICMP echo messages and expects four consecutive ICMP echo replies from the destination. The IOS ping sends five ICMP echo messages and displays an indicator for each ICMP echo reply received

### Extended Ping
- The Cisco IOS offers an "Extended" mode of the ping command
- Extended ping is entered in the privileged exec mode by typing `ping` without a destination IP address
	- You will then be given several prompts to customize the ping

- Pressing enter accepts the indicated values. The ping ipv6 command is used for ipv6 pings

#### Verify Connectivity with Trace route
- The ping command is useful to quickly determine if there is a layer 3 connectivity problem. However, it does not identify where the problem is located along the path.
	- Traceroute can help locate a Layer 3 problem area in a network. A trace returns a list of hops as a packet is routed through a network
	- The syntax of the trace command varies between operating systems

- The following is an sample output of `tracert` command on a windows 10 host
- The only successful response was from the gateway on R1. Trace requests to the next hop timed out as indicated by the asterisk (* ) meaning the next hop router did not respond or there is a failure in the network path. In this example there appears to be a problem between R1 and R2

##### Extended Trace route
- Like the extended ping command, there is also an extended `traceroute` command. It allows the administrator to adjust parameters related to the command operation

### Network Baseline
- One of the most effective tools in monitoring and troubleshooting network performance is to establish a network baseline
- One method for starting a baseline is to copy and paste the results from an executed ping, trace, or other relevant commands into a text file. These text files can be time stamped with the data and saved into an archive for later retrieval and comparison
- Among the items to consider are error messages and the response times from host to host
- Corporate networks should have extensive baselines; more extensive than what we will delve into
