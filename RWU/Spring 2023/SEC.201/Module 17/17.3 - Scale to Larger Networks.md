# 17.3 - Scale to Larger Networks
---
## Small Network Growth
- Growth is a natural process for many small businesses, and their networks must grow accordingly. Ideally, the network admin has enough lead-time to make intelligent decisions about growing the network in alignment with the growth of the company

- To scale a network, several elements are required:
	- **Network documentation**
		- Physical and logical topology
	- **Device Inventory**
		- List of devices that use or comprise the network
	- **Budget**
		- Itemized IT budget, including fiscal year equipment purchasing budget
	- **Traffic Analysis**
		- Protocols, applications, and services and their respective traffic requirements should be documented

- These elements are used to inform the decision-making that accompanies the scaling of a small network

### Protocol Analysis
- It is important to understand the type of traffic that is crossing the network as well as the current traffic flow. There are several network management tools that can be used for this purpose

- To determine traffic flow patterns, it is important to do the following
	- Capture traffic during peak utilization to get a good representation of the different traffic types
	- Perform the capture on different network segments and devices as some traffic will be local to a particular segment
	- Information gathered by the protocol analyzer is evaluated based on the source and destination of the traffic, as well as the type of traffic being sent
	- This analysis can be used to make decisions on how to manage the traffic more efficiently

### Employee Network Utilization
- Many operating systems provide built in tools to display such network utilization information. These tools can be used to capture a "snapshot" of information such as the following:
	- OS and OS Version
	- CPU utilization
	- RAM utilization
	- Drive utilization
	- Non-Network Applications
	- Network Applications

- Documenting snapshots for employees in a small network over a period of time is very useful to identify evolving protocol requirements and associate traffic flows
