# 10.3 - Configure the Default Gateway
---
## Default Gateway on a Host
- The default gateway is used when a host sends a packet to a device on another network
- The default gateway address is generally the router interface address attached to the local network of the host
- To reach PC3, PC1 addresses a packet with the IPv4 address of PC3, but forwards the packet to its default gateway, the G0/0/0 interface of R1

## Default Gateway on a Switch
- A switch must have a default gateway address configured to remotely manage the switch from another network
- To configure an IPv4 default gateway on a switch, use the `ip default-gateway ip-address` global configuration command
