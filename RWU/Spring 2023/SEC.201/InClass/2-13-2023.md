>Doug isn't going to be here in person this Thursday, 02/16

### Binary Numbers
- tons of videos online if you need extra aid
	- including a TON by Doug
	- Need to know at least until 8 bits

- Decimal is base 10
- ==**Binary is base 2**==
	- going to need to know 8 bits
	- $2^0$ through $2^7$
- **==Hexadecimal is base 16==**

#### First 8 Powers
| Power of 2 | Equals |
| ---------- | ------ |
| $2^0$      | 1      |
| $2^1$      | 2      |
| $2^2$      | 4      |
| $2^3$      | 8      |
| $2^4$      | 16     |
| $2^5$      | 32     |
| $2^6$      | 64     |
| $2^7$      | 128    |

- Each 4 bits is called a **nibble**
- 2 **nibbles** make a **byte**
	- A nibble ranges from 0 to 15

- 01010101
	- 64 + 16 + 4 + 1 = 85 

### Hexadecimal Numbers
#### Conversion Chart
![[SEC.201 Hex.jpeg|500]]

#### Hexadecimal example
- Every nibble in binary is a single digit in hex
>[! tip] Memorize
>You're better off memorizing the process, then when needed, you can replicate the chart above by knowing the processes

>[! example] Story time with Doug
>While teaching in Colorado, Doug had a student attend his final while heavily armed with several guns. Luckily, the student liked Doug. He liked him so much that when he saw Doug's profile photo for the school, which wasn't as good as he thought it should be, he threatened violence unless it was changed. No one was harmed and the conflict was resolved peacefully.
>- And now back to hexadecimal

- We then ran through several practice problems, converting from decimal into binary, and then into hexadecimal
