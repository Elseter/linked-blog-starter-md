## TCP and UDP Protocol Notes
- There are lectures about most of this but some additional components to mention
- A Socket is when a client and a server are connected on each end 
	- Daemons are apps that "listen" for connections and act as either an intermediary or endpoint for a connection
- A socket has two port numbers, a **source** and **destination** port
- Destination ports are often used as security and hacking references
- There are 65,536 (0xFFFF) ports possible on a wintel machine
- You can't put 0xFFFF on a license plate in RI

- Daemons listen for connections on ports
- Syn packets are sent out to connect to daemons
	- if successful, the daemon will send back a syn ack
- When connecting to a website, DNS (another daemon) will convert it to an IP address with port number
- Daemons can fork new jobs, and fork them off to other ports
	- This is how daemons handle multiple people attempting to connect at once

### 3 way handshake
- TCP/IP
- Client sends `syn` packet to server
- Server replies to source port with `syn ack` packet
- Client then sends a `syn ack` packet back to the server to acknowledge its acknowledgement

### Understanding Ports
- In most server side daemons:
	- You can define port numbers in the configuration file
	- This means you can typically set up any daemon to run on any available port
	- But: Many common services have "established" ports which are expected as defaults
		- For instance, http browsers use TCP/80 and TCP/443 for http and https respectively
		- There is no requirement that you run these daemons on these ports, but if you don't, you will have to make the web links which include the port numbers
		- It is possible to support many websites on a single IP using different ports

- Cautions about this:
	- Do not kid yourself that a port change will prevent someone finding your daemon
	- Security through obscurity is naïve, really naïve

### Ports to be aware of
- 20-21 == ftpd
	- This is in the clear
	- Plaintext
	- files transferred using this method can be completely intercepted 
- 22 == Secure Shell
	- A replacement for telnet
	- encrypted
- 23 == telnet
	- An in the clear tool which allows CLI access to servers
	- Sends everything in the clear
- 25 == SMTP
	- Unencrypted send mail port. This is where the mail is "sent" when you hit the send button
	- This is an ancient protocol
- 80 == http
	- Unencrypted html listening daemon
- 443 == https
	- Encrypted html listening daemon

- TCP/UDP 53 == DNS
- TCP/UDP 123 == NTP 
	- Network Time Protocol
- TCP/UDP 65 == dhcp
