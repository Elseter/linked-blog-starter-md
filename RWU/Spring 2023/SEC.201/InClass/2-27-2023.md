## Some info on VLANs
- One of the most troublesome and tricky aspects of Layer 2
- VLANs are used to virtualize software, without requiring the expensive hardware components

### A VLAN is a virtual network at layer 2
- In an ethernet frame (802.3) there is reserved space for something called an 802.1q tag
- This is a 32 bit field which is reserved in the header of the frame
	- 12 bits of this are reserved for what is called a VLAN ID
	- 12 bits == 4096 (VLANs numbers can be used between 0 and 4095)

#### 802.1q tag
- This tag is used at Layer 2 to organize traffic at the switch layer
- VLAN 1 is the default on Cisco Devices
- When a switch port is set to a specific VLAN it can only talk to that VLAN
- Each switchport can be set to a specific VLAN
	- Breaks a single switch into several virtual switches
- Switch ports which are set to a "trunk" mode can forward the traffic of multiple VLANs on a single wire
	- Trunks are necessary to connect switches together that can have multiple VLANS
	- It records the VLAN info even if it crosses a layer 3 boundary
- Each VLAN is treated as a totally isolated network that cannot communicate with any other network segment 
- A VLAN is a way of grouping together at layer 2 and can be considered a basic form of security and network segmentation

#### VLANs
- Require a layer 3 device if you want inter-vlan connections
- VLANs are intra communications
- The vlan tag can be preserved in layer 3 but require some special actions

**Dogma** : Something/a pattern of behavior that you believe in and follow
**Schema** : the actual design and implementation of your "dogma"

### In Class Demo
- Doug has pre-built a Layer 2 network with switches and VLANs 
- L7 ms mgmt
	- Layer 7 Microsoft global management system
	- Servers plugged into individual VLANs that can administer their VLAN but not interact with others
