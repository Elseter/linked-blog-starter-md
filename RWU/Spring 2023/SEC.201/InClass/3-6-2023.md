## More Routing
>[! tip] Study 
>Remember to study for the Modules 4-7 exam that will be next class, Thursday March 9th

### Two main Dynamic Routing algorithms
**Distance Vectors** - These types of protocols advertise their information to any connected routers at a regular interval
- Every so often I'm going to update (interval)
	- To fast and the network can't keep up
	- To slow and the network rapidly falls out of date

**Link State** - These devices only update when a change occurs in the network
- Updates on a change of state of a device
	- Router interface goes up
		- Triggers state change
	- Router interface goes down
		- Triggers state change
	- Called convergence

>[! bug] Flapping
>`Flapping` is a term that is used to describe an interface that is rapidly going up and down
>- Causes a link state algorithm to go crazy
>- Updates incredibly rapidly to keep up with flapping

### Administrative Distance
- Routers have to establish a "score" of some sort which is a collection of "metrics" which are used to determine the "distance" of a particular route
- Higher numbers in distance represent less appealing choices but they can be used to evaluate any given link
- So, it's possible to choose a route, when more than one exists, by choosing the shortest "distance"

| Route Type         | Admin Distance |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Directly Connected | 0              |
| Static Route       | 1              |
| Default Route      | 1              |
| EIGRP Summary      | 5              |
| eBGP               | 20             |
| EIGRP              | 90             |
| OSPF               | 110            |
| IS-IS              | 115            |
| RIP                | 120            |
| EIGRP External     | 170            |
| iBGP               | 200            |
| Unknown             | 255               |
- The backbone of the internet runs on eBGP
- EIGRP is a Cisco proprietary product
- OSPF is an open source (open shortest path first)

### What does it all mean
- A directly connected option would almost always be chosen since it has a score of 0

#### Other metrics
- EIGRP uses a formula which can be configured
- Determines an administered distance score
	- Uses Bandwidth
	- Load
	- Delay
	- Measures of Reliability

##### Additionally
- EIGRP only works on Cisco equipment
- Don't mess with the K values
- Use OSPF if you are in doubt about your equipment
