### The rest of OSI
#### Next Week
- 14-15 exam is next Thursday
- 16-17 exam is Monday the 8th
- The final for this class will be virtual and online
	- 2:45 on the 16th of May

### Layer 5
- The **session layer** is where the packets established in this connection (by layers 1 - 4) are managed. 
- Sequence numbers, ect. are all used to manage the flow of data out of and into the stack

### Layer 6
- **Presentation layer **
	- translates things from the base protocols at l7 into something the stack can handle
- TLS is the transport layer security protocol. It basically is used to encrypt and decrypt things coming down from the application layer or up from the session layer
- TLS was first published in 1999 by IETF
- Current version is 1.3
- SSL was the older version and now deprecated version that used to be used for https
- Not all things support TLS 1.3

#### More TLS Stuff
- Basically TLS is a process where a server establishes an in the clear session
- Then negotiates a secure connection
- The two endpoints have to initiate a connection and then negotiate which version of encryption they are going to use in order to establish the session
- DTLS is the version for use in UDP traffic

#### TLS Versions
- 1.0 and 1.1 are both deprecated by RFC 8996 which was issued in 2021
	- Both of these have security flaws which resulted in them being stolen
- TLS 1.2 came out in 2008. This was the first version that had no backward compatibility

#### How this works
- Typically when you initiate a web connection
- The browser:
	- Issues a DNS request on port 53 to the designated dns server and retrieves an IP
	- Then a syn packet is sent to that IP on port 80 TCP
	- A syn ack is received and replied to establishing a session on port 80

- The traffic is renegotiated up onto port 443 which means that communications will be occurring encrypted using https after that
	- Th browser requests a key and the key is encrypted using the public key on each end. The two private keys are then used to exchange encrypted traffic

#### There are many attacks directed at TLS
- This is the majority of web traffic, it gets tested A LOT
- Heart-bleed is a really famous one
	- Heart-bleed was found on TLS 1 and 1.1 and basically, because the keys were stored in memory at a specific location, and the heart-bleed bug allows someone to read those locations, the secret private keys could be compromised 
	- Resulted in something like 17% of webservers that existed in 2014 were still vulnerable to these attacks

### The Application layer
- This is where the communications starts and ends for humans
- Protocols which are long established are commonly used here as an interface between the system and the network
- Html is a good example
- Html is a "markup language" which allows tags to be used around text which manipulate the browser screen. Html uses asc ii as a means of sending things (all in text) across the internet 
- FTP, TELNET, SSH, and other things also exist here for your use as a developer
- Understand, you can embed telnet underneath your UI and create a massively insecure app
