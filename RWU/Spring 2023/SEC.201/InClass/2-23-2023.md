- This is layer 2
- Doug pulls up a large "flat" network on packet tracer
	- "flat" network is only on Data Link Layer

## Understanding Layer 2 and Flat Networks
- This is how the first networks were set up
	- 2005 or so
- Contains MAC address to identify devices
	- MAC is 48 bits long
- In a flat network, everyone can see everyone else
- Layer 2 switches
	- Use MAC addresses to identify ports and devices attached to those ports
	- Use fastEthernet 
		- speed of 100mb
		- most common speed for recreational use

>[! tip] Doug Tip
>Port 9100 UDP is the port that printers listen on for code

### Sniffers
- Doug uses these in packet tracer 
- We can also use these as installed programs
	- The most common of these is **Wireshark**
		- It is a passive tool... only listens
		- I downloaded it during class. Its pretty interesting

	- nmap is another tool
		- It is an active tool... actively engages with the network
	- shodan
		- freemium tool
		- scans the whole world
#### DHCP
- Dynamic Host Control Protocol
	- Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on the network that request IP addresses

#### Core Switch
- Cisco prefers that we use a core switch that is in a rack somewhere
- Then distribution switches are attached to the core switch
	- Then users connect to these distribution switches
