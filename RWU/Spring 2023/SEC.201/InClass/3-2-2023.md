## Routing
- Choosing the most optimal path to reach your destination while fulfilling desired constraints
	- Most common constraint is time

### Google Maps
- Take points
	- take speed limit of the road
	- Figure out what is the fastest route by determining distance and speed that that distance can be legally covered in
- Produces optimal route
- This is essentially the same technique that is employed to move packets from source to destination

### Routers
- Routers don't know about far away places if they haven't sent data there before
- Routers make 3 decisions when they see a packet
	1. Drop
		- Blackhole
		- Dev/null
		- If the router doesn't know the destination, the packet is dropped
	2. Keep
		- If the router is directly connected to the destination, then it will keep the packet
	3. Forward
		- More complicated
		- Router doesn't know what to do with the packet, but doesn't drop it
		- Forwards the packet

### Routing Table
- **Static Route**
	- you set a route manually for where the device should forward 
- **Dynamic Routing**
	- Learns how to get places
	- BGP
		- Routing protocol used by backbone providers
		- learns the best route between two locations
- **Default**
	- If you don't know what to do with it, send it to someone else to deal with it
	- default route to send packets

#### Priority
- Static
- Dynamic
- Default / Route of Last Resort
