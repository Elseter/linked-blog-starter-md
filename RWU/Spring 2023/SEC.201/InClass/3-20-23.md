Welcome back after Spring Break!!
You're halfway there

## Routing (Layer 3)
- This is about **inter**LAN connection
	- LANs use MAC address which are 48 bits

### NICs
- two major types
	- Ethernet NIC
	- WLAN NIC

### Addresses
- 198.7.244
	- IP Address
	- each . separates an octet (8 bits)
- public IPS
- RFC 1918 private

- Each NIC **must** be a separate network
	- 198.7.244
- As a router works, it fills in its routing table 
	- As well as the administrative distance of each connection via each path

- A router will take a packet, strip off the layer 2 information to reveal the layer 3 (network layer) header
	- Then it reads the L3 info to determine if it knows the appropriate path to forward the packet down
	- If it does, it re-encapsulates the packet with new L2 information and passes it along

#### 1.1.1.
- if the router doesn't know where the packet should go, it drops it
- That said, routing tables can be MASSIVE
	- they can be set up with defaults or scenerios.
		- If it doesn't know, send it on (but only if you set it to do so)

### IOS
- Cisco owned this name before Apple
- This is the name of the operating system that Cisco owns and designs
- This is where most of the cost of the Cisco router comes from
	- It is Licensed and can not be redistributed
	- You should check the versions
		- The versions are hardware specific
		- Typically controlled with RAM
			- 6mb RAM for these features
			- 8mb RAM for these features
			- Soldier RAM

### Connections
#### SSH
- Port 22/TCP
- Secure, Encrypted
- Locks after certain number of password attempts
#### telnet
- Port 23/TCP
- VERY Insecure
- infinite password attempts
- In the clear, not encrypted
- Very easy to listen in
#### FTP
- File download
- Port 21/TCP and 20/TCP
- In the clear
#### SFTP
- Port 22/TCP
- Encrypted

### Cisco Routers
- 2811
	- Modular Router
		- Default config:
			- 2 fast ethernet NICs
- For a small company, this would sit at the edge of your network, between you and the internet
	- The next device up would likely belong to the ISP
