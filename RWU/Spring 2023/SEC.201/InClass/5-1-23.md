### Disclaimer
- The story of Cap is a work of Fiction
- Cap stories are composites made up of different consulting jobs Doug has done and the people who worked there

#### The Power Station Building
- This building was across the street from the old Yankee Stadium]
- It is a four story building with 2 subbasements
- The goal is to build out the networking in the building such that four separate television sound stages will exist on the top floors and 2 floors of administration, editing, and such are in the basement
	- The lowest basement is too creepy so they will use it for storage which somehow doesn't make it less creepy, but I guess at least, those miserable losers won't have to go down there. Only the networking crew
- There is an administrative network for the managers and such
- There is a guest network for people that are just hanging around
