## Subnetting Exam
- This Thursday, April 13th, there will be a replacement subnetting exam
- We will review the questions 1 by 1 from the previous exam to see what went wrong
- Class average (prior to corrections) was 53%

#### Question 1 (61%)
- Consider 10.1.1.0/28. What is the broadcast address of the secondary network
- /28 means that the first 3 octets are 1s and can be ignored

	- The answer will include 10.1.1.
	- Then there at 4 network bits in final octet that are sanctioned as network bits
		- This means that each network will jump by 16 ($2^4$)
		- First Network = 10.1.1.0 - 10.1.1.15
		- Second Network = 10.1.1.16 - 10.1.1.31

#### Question 2 (32%)
- Consider 172.16.1.0/24. You need 3 networks with the maximum number of hosts. What is the best subnet to use to achieve your goals

	- You need at least 2 bits to have 3 subnets
	- That means that you will have a network address of 
		- 255.255.255.192
		- or /26

#### Question 3 (39%)
- Given 192.168.1.0/24. You need at least 75 hosts per network. How many networks will it be possible to have and still accommodate the host requirements?

	- It takes at least 7 bits to write 75
	- That means that you need 7 bits for the host
	- Only 1 bit remaining for the network
		- Either on or off
		- 2 options aka 2 networks

#### Question 4 (77%)
- Given the subnet 192.168.13.0/24. Two networks already exist, 192.168.13.0/26 and 192.168.13.64/26. You want to add another network, what would the address be?

	- /26 means that 2 bits are turned on in the subnet mask in both existing networks
	- The first two networks will jump by 64 
	- Network 1 : 0 - 63
	- Network 2: 64 - 127
		- The next possible network can begin at 128

#### Question 5 (55%)
- Given 10.1.1.0/29 
- Consider two ip addresses 10.1.1.11 and 10.1.1.17. Which answer best describes the situation

	- Are these in different subnets?
	- First network : 0 - 7
	- Second Network : 8 - 15
	- Third Network : 16 - 23
		- These are in two different networks
		- They can not ping another

#### Question 6 (23%)
- Given 192.168.10.0/24. You need 7 subnets and you need to use the rest of the space for hosts. How many hosts would be possible in an optimized network? This is asking for a number, not a mask

	- Need 7 subnets
		- Requires 3 bits to create 8 subnets
		- Leaves us with 5 bits for hosts
			- $2^5$ results in 32 options for each network
				- However, the first option is the network address and the last option is the broadcast address
				- Neither of these can be used for hosts
				- 32 - first - last = 30 possible hosts

#### Question 7 (77%)
- Given 10.1.1.0/30. What is the network address of the IP 10.1.1.75?

- /30 means that there are 6 network address segments
	- that means that each network is jumping by 4
	- What is the closest multiple of 4 that is less than 75

#### Question 8 (45%)
- Given 192.168.15.0 /28. What is the first valid host address in the third network

- /28 means 4 network bits
	- That means that we are jumping by 16
	- First Network : 0
	- Second Network : 16
	- Third Network : 32
		- First address : 33

#### Question 9 (26%)
- Given 172.16.0.0/16. You need 150 networks and all the rest should be reserved for hosts. What is the best subnet mask to use?

- You need 8 bits to write 150
- That means you need 8 network bits
- This results in the subnet mask /24 or 255.255.255.0

#### Question 10 (94%)
- Given that there are 5 interfaces on a router on a stick setup. The first 4 interfaces have the following addresses
	- 10.1.1.1
	- 10.1.1.33
	- 10.1.1.64
	- 10.1.1.97

- Going up by 32
- The answer is 10.1.1.129
