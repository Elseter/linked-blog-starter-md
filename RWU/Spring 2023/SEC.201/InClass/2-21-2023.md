## Layer 2 Switching (Data Link Layer)
- Data Link Layer
- Local Area Network (LAN)
	- LAN works through the data link layer
	- Original LAN parties employed OSI layer 2

### MAC addresses
- MAC addresses are used to identify devices
	- MAC addresses are 48 bits
	- written in hex
	- 2, 24 bit chunks 
		- First 24 bits are a manufacture's ID
			- Can be used to identify devices (or NICs)
		- Last 24 bits are a serial number
		- This creates a unique identifier
			- Only used on local area networks (LANs)

### Switches
- We will be talking about layer 2 switches
	- layer 3 switches also exist, but have a different function
- A switch typically has multiple NICs (network interface card) inside of it 
	- Each NIC has its own MAC address
- The MAC addresses of each NIC communicate with each other, much like how how two telephones communicate with another (MAC Address = Telephone numbers)

>[! tip] Doug Tip
>In Packet Tracer, when you connect two devices, green blips may pop up. These indicate that there is an electrical connection between the two devices. HOWEVER, it does not indicate that the network is working

- For a short while, Switches will remember the MAC addresses of devices that have utilized their network. 
	- The connected devices must make initial contact or be sensed through a ping
	- The MAC address table will be pruned after a period of time to save space

### Flat Network
- A flat network is a network located entirely on the Data Link Layer
- All devices on this network know about each other
- This makes it easy to circumvent security on certain devices
