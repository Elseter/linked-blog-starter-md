# 3.6 - Data Encapsulation
---
## Segmenting Messages
- Segmenting is the process of breaking up messages into smaller units
- Multiplexing is the processes of taking multiple streams of segmented data and interweaving them together

- Segmenting messages has two primary benefits
	- **Increased Speed:**
		- Large amounts of data can be sent over the network without tying up a communications link
	- **Increased Efficiency:**
		- Only segments which fail to reach the destination need to be retransmitted, not the entire data stream

## Sequencing
- Sequencing messages is the process of numbering segments so that the message may be reassembled at the destination
- TCP is responsible for sequencing the individual segments

## Protocol Data Units
- Encapsulation is the process where protocols add their information to the data
	- At each state of the process, a PDU has a different name to reflect its new functions
	
	- There is no universal naming convention for PDUs, in this course, the PDUs are named according to the protocols of the TCP/IP suite

	- PDUs passing down the stack are as follows
		1. Data (Data Stream)
		2. Segment
		3. Packet
		4. Frame
		5. Bits

## Encapsulation Example
- **Encapsulation is a top down process**
- The level above does its process and then passes it down to the next level of the model
	- This process is repeated by each layer until it is sent out as a bit stream

### De-encapsulation
- Data is de-encapsulated as it moves up the stack
- When a layer completes its process, that layer strips off its header and passes it up to the next level to be processed
	- This is repeated at each layer until it is a data stream that the application can process
	1. Received as Bits
	2. Frame
	3. Packet
	4. Segment
	5. Data (data stream)
