# 3.3 - Protocol Suites
---
## Network Protocol Suites
- Protocols must be able to work with other protocols
- Protocol suite:
	- A group of inter-related protocols necessary to preform a communication function
	- Sets of rules that work together to help solve a problem
- The protocols are viewed in terms of layers
	- Higher Layers - governing rules
	- Lower Layers - concerned with moving data and provide services to upper layers
		- how it actually gets moved

>Protocol Suites are essential a collection of rules that allow for communications to occur

## Evolution of Protocol Suites
- There are several Protocol Suites
**Internet Protocol Suite or TCP/IP**
- The most common protocol suite and maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
**Open System Interconnection (OSI) protocols**
- Developed by the international Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
**Apple Talk**
- Proprietary suite release by Apple Inc.
**Novell NetWare**
- Proprietary suite developed by Novell Inc

## TCP/IP Protocol Example
- TCP/IP protocols operate at the application, transport, and internet layers
- The most common network access layer LAN protocols are Ethernet and WLAN (wireless LAN)

## TCP/IP Protocol Suite
- TCP/IP is the protocol suite used by the internet and includes many protocols
**TCP/IP is:**
- An open standard protocol suite that is freely available to the public and can be used by any vendor
- A standards-based protocol suite that is endorsed by the networking industry and approved by a standards organization to ensure interoperability

## TCP/IP Communication Process
- A web server encapsulating and sending a web page to a client

- A client de-encapsulating the web page for the web browser
