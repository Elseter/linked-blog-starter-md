# 3.7 - Data Access
---
## Addresses
- Both the data link (**Layer 2**) and network layers (**Layer 3**) use addressing to deliver data from source to destination

**Network layer source and destination addresses:**
- Responsible for delivering the IP packet from original source to the final destination
**Data link layer source and destination addresses:**
- Responsible for delivering the data link frame from one network interface card to another NIC on the same network

## Layer 3 Logical Address
The IP packet contains two IP addresses:
- **Source IP address:**
	- The IP address of the sending device, original source of the packet
- **Destination IP Address:**
	- The IP address of the receiving device, final destination of the packet

- These addresses may be on the same link or remote

An IP address contains two parts:
- **Network portion (IPv4) pr Prefix (IPv6):
	- The left-most part of the address indicates the network group which the IP address is a member
	- Each LAN or WAN will have the same network portion
- **Host portion (IPv4) or Interface ID (IPv6):**
	- The remaining part of the address identifies a specific device within the group
	- This portion is unique for each device on the network

## Devices on the same network
- When devices are on the same network the source and destination will have the same number in network portion of the address
	- PC - **192.168.1**.110
	- FTP Server - **192.168.1**.9

- A layer two device will care about the host portion of the address and direct traffic to the correct location

## Role of the Data Link Layer Addresses: Same IP Network
- When devices are on the same ethernet network the data link frame will use the actual MAC address of the destination NIC

- MAC addresses are physically embedded into the ethernet NIC and are local addressing
	- The Source MAC address will be that of the originator on the link
	- The Destination MAC address will always be the same link as the source, even if the ultimate destination is remote

## Role of the Network Layer Addresses
When the source and destination have different network portions, this means they are on different networks 
- PC - 192.168.1
- Web Server - 172.16.1

## Role of the Data Link Layer Addresses: Different IP Networks
When the final destination is remote, Layer 3 will provide Layer 2 with the local default gateway IP address, also known as the router address
- The default gateway (DGW) is the router interface IP address that is part of this LAN and will be the "door" to other remote locations
- All devices on the LAN must be told about this address or their traffic will be confined to the LAN only
- Once Layer 2 on PC forwards to the default gateway (router), the router then can start the routing process of getting the information to actual destination

- The data link addressing is local addressing so it will have a source and destination for each link
- The MAC addressing for the first segment is:
	- Source: - AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA
		- PC Sends the frame
	- Destination: - 11-11-11-11-11-11
		- R1 - Default Gateway MAC
		- Receives the frame
>[! tip]
>While the layer 2 local addressing will change from link to link or hop to hop, the layer 3 addressing will remain the same

## Data Link Addresses
- Since data link addressing is local addressing, it will have a source and destination for each segment or hop of the journey to the destination
- The MAC addressing for the first segment is:
	- Source: - (PC NIC) sends frame
	- Destination: - (First Router - DGW interface) receives frame

- The MAC addressing for the second hop is:
	- Source: - (First Router - exit interface) sends frame
	- Destination: - (Second Router) receives frame

- The MAC addressing for the last segment is:
	- Source: - (Second Router - exit interface) sends frame
	- Destination: - (Web Server NIC) receives frame

- Notice that the packet is not modified, but the frame is changed, therefore the L3 IP addressing does not change from segment to segment like the L2 MAC addressing
- The L3 addressing remains the same since it is global and the ultimate destination is still the web server
