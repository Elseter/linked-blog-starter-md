# 3.5 - Reference Models
---
## The Benefits of Using a Layered Model
- Complex concepts such as how a network operates can be difficult to explain and understand, for this reason a layered model is used
- Two layered models describe network operations
	- **Open System Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model**
	- **TCP/IP Reference Model**
![[SEC.201 Networking Model.jpg]]

### Benefits Continued
- Assist in protocol design because protocols that operate at a specific layer have defined information that they act upon and a define interface to the layers above and below
- Foster competition because products from different vendors can work together
- Prevent technology or capability changes in one layer from affecting other layers
- Provide a common language to describe networking functions and capabilities

## OSI Model Visualized
| OSI Model Layer  | Description                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7 - Application  | Contains protocols used for process-to-process communications                                 |
| 6 - Presentation | Provides for common representation of the data transferred between application layer services |
| 5 - Session      | Provides services to the presentation layer and manage data exchange                          |
| 4 - Transport    | Defines services to segment, transfer, and reassemble the data for individual communications  |
| 3 - Network      | Provides services to exchange the individual pieces of data over the network                  |
| 2 - Data Link    | Describes methods for exchanging data frames over a common media\                             |
| 1 - Physical     | Describes the means to activate, maintain, and de-activate physical connections                                                                                              |

## TCP/IP Model Visualized
| TCP/IP Model Layer | Description                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application        | Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control         |
| Transport          | Supports communication between various device across diverse networks |
| Internet           | Determines the best path through the network                          |
| Network Access     | Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network      |

## OSI v.s TCP/IP
- See top image for side by side comparison
- The OSI model divides the network access layer and the application layer of the TCP/IP model into multiple layers

- The TCP/IP protocol suite does not specify which protocols to use when transmitting over a physical medium

- OSI Layers 1 and 2 discuss the necessary procedures to access the media and the physical means to send data over a network
