# 3.2 - Protocols
---
## Network Protocol Overview
- Network protocols define a common set of rules
- They can be implement on devices in:
	- Software
	- Hardware
	- Both
- Protocols have their own:
	- Function
	- Format
	- Rules

| Protocol Type          | Description                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Network Communications | enable two or more device to communicate over one or more networks                               |
| Network Security       | secure data to provide authentication, data integrity, and data encryption                       |
| Routing                | enable routers to exchange route information, compare path information, and select the best path |
| Service Discovery      | used for the automatic detection of devices or services                                                                                                 |

## Network Protocol Functions
- Devices use agreed-upon protocols to communicate
- Protocols may have one or more functions

| Function              | Description                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Addressing            | Identifies sender and receiver                        |
| Reliability           | Provides guaranteed delivery                          |
| Flow Control          | Ensures data flows at an efficient rate               |
| Sequencing            | Uniquely labels each transmitted segment of data      |
| Error Detection       | Determines if data became corrupt during transmission |
| Application Interface | Process-to-process communications between network applications                                                      |

## Protocol Interaction
- Networks require the use of several protocols
- Each protocol has its own function and format

| Protocol                            | Function                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  | Governs the way a web server and web client connect. Defines content and format        |
| Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) | Manges the individual conversations. Provides guaranteed delivery. Manges flow control |
| Internet Protocol (IP)              | Delivers messages globally from the sender to the receiver                             |
| Ethernet                            | Delivers messages from one NIC to another NIC on the same Ethernet Local Area Network                                                                                       |
