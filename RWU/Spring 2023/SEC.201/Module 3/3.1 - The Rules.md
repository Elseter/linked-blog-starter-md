# 3.1 - The Rules
---
## Communication Fundamentals
- Networks can vary in size and complexity
	- It is not enough to have a connection
	- Devices must agree on "How" to communicate

- There are three elements to any communication
	- There will be a source (sender)
	- There will be a destination (receiver)
	- There will be a channel (media) that provides for the path of communications to occur

## Communication Protocols
- All Communications are governed by protocols
- Protocols are the rules that communications will follow
- These rules will vary depending on the protocol
	- Message source > Transmitter > Transmission medium > Receiver > Message Destination

## Rule Establishment
- Individuals must use established rules or agreements to govern the conversation
- The first message is difficult to read because it is not formatted properly. The second shows the message properly formatted

- Protocols must account for the following requirements
	- An identified sender and receiver
	- Common language and grammar
	- Speed and timing of delivery
	- Confirmation or acknowledgement requirements

## Network Protocol Requirements
- Common computer protocols must be in agreement and include the following requirements
	- Message encoding
	- Message formatting and encapsulation
	- Message size
	- Message timing
	- Message delivery options

### Message Encoding
- Encoding is the process of converting information into another acceptable form of transmission
- Decoding reverse this process to interpret the information

### Message Formatting and Encapsulation
- When a message is sent, it must be a specific format or structure
- Message formats depend on the type of message and the channel that is used to deliver the message

### Message Size
- Encoding between hosts must be in the appropriate format for the medium
	- messages sent across the network are converted to bits
	- the bits are encoded into a patter of light, sound, or electrical impulses
	- the destination host must decode the signals to interpret the message

### Message Timing
- Includes the following:
**Flow Control:**
- Manages the rate of data transmission and defines how much information can be sent and the speed at which it can be delivered
**Response Timeout:**
- Manages how long a device waits when it does not hear a reply from the destination
**Access method:**
- Determines when someone can send a message
	- There may be various rules governing issues like "collisions". This is when more than one device sends traffic at the same time and the messages become corrupt
	- Some protocols are proactive and attempt to prevent collisions; other protocols are reactive and establish a recovery method after the collision occurs

### Message Delivery Options
- Message delivery may be one of the following methods:
	- **Unicast** - one to one communication
	- **Multicast** - one to may, typically not all
	- **Broadcast** - one to all

>[! def] Note
>Broadcasts are used in IPv4 networks, but are not an option for IPv6
>- Later we will also see "Anycast" as an additional delivery option for IPv6

## A note about the Node Icon
- Documents may use the node icon, typically a circle, to represent all devices
- The figure illustrates the use of the node icon for the delivery options
