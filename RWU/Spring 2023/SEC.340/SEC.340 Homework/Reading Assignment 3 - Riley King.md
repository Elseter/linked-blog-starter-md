## Reading Assignment #3: 
Please read the third chapter in the Singh book and respond to the following questions. 

1. (page 107-115)When the Zimmerman telegram was deciphered by the cryptanalysts of Britain’s Room 40, Admiral William Hall decided not to tell American President Woodrow Wilson about its contents because doing so might let the Germans know that Britain was capable of breaking their codes. Given the danger posed to America by the unrestricted U-boat warfare indicated in the telegram, was this ethical of Admiral Hall? 

>[! done] Answer for 1
>So Admiral Hall had the following decision in front of him. He held an intercepted message that informed the reader that unmitigated submarine warfare was to break out in the Atlantic. It additionally invited multiple foreign nations to attack another (which at the time was not engaged in hostilities with anyone). If he informed the U.S, he would almost be guaranteed to be saving lives and preventing conflict in the Americas. However, he would risk the US not be as enraged as they would be if they were attacked unannounced. In handing over the message, he would risk not getting the aid of the US joining the war on the side of the allies. He choose to withhold the message and innocents died. However, in the end, he did get what he wanted, although he was finally forced to show the message to the Americans. It becomes a question of hypotheticals. Would the US have joined the war if he had immediately provided the message immediately? Would the US joining the war save more lives? If the answer to those is yes, then I suppose his actions could be seen as ethical. However, I'm more inclined to say his actions were understandable, rather than ethical

2. Germany learned that Britain had broken their codes from histories of the First World War written by Winston Churchill and the British Royal Navy (page 141). Given that this knowledge prompted Germany to invest in the Enigma machine technology prior to the Second World War, should these histories have been published? What might have motivated Britain to make their code-breaking success known in this fashion? 

>[! done] Answer for 2
>I doubt anyone at the time was expecting another conflict so soon after the first. However, in the pursuit of absolute security, those histories should not have been published. Luckily, I don't side with absolute security and am in favor of them having been published. The nature of shared information is what allows for technology to grow and progress. What I am not in favor of is how that knowledge was used to aid in encrypting messages from Nazis. I suspect that national pride played a large role in why these histories were published. Additionally, if Churchill believed that they may bolster his image and aid in re-election, that certainly could have contributed to their release

3. Given the various incidents recounted in this chapter, what are some conditions that seem favorable to the advancement of military cryptography? 

>[! done] Answer for 3
>It seems, that based on the information provided in this chapter, that military cryptography thrives in times of conflict, especially conflict were opponents have exceptional code breakers. Additionally, it thrives when code makers find out when their codes have been broken. Understanding how a code was broken aids in the construction of an even stronger one. Additionally, the ease at which messages can be intercepted aids in the advancement of military cryptography. This was most evident this chapter with the invention of the radio and how that renewed interest in cryptography.

4. Singh’s examples of breaking difficult codes (such as the example beginning on page 116 about a keyword as long as the plaintext) seem to make breaking such codes (relatively) straightforward. Why are these codes so much more difficult to break in practice?

>[! done] Answer for 4
>You're essentially trying to crack the keyword by guessing sections of the encrypted and plaintext to match. However, if the key doesn't have a pattern and avoids repeating using similar phrases multiple times, you're in a very similar boat to someone trying to crack a random keyword. Additionally, you may not know if there is a pattern to the keyword or if the keyword is even a phrase at all. You could be trying to crack a random full length keyword with no possibility of success.
