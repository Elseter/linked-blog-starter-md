#### Question 1
1. Milk Chocolate (aka “plain”) M&M’s come in six different colors. According to the manufacturer, 23% of these M&M’s are blue, 14% are brown, 16% are green, 20% are orange, 13% are red, and 14% are yellow. Suppose you open up a pack of M&M’s and pour out two candies. What is the probability that these two are the same color? Show enough steps to receive full credits.

>[! done] Answer for Question 1
>So, we need to pour out two candies and determine the odds that both candies are the same color. The problem states the probability of acquiring a single M and M of each type. Since we are not provided any further information, I will be assuming that the removal of a single M and M does not effect the odds of the next one, although in reality, it would (especially with smaller qualities). The odds two events happen, is there probabilities multiplied by each other. So first, I'll calculate the probability that we acquire the same color twice for each color. 
>Blue = $0.23*0.23 = 0.0529$
>Brown = $0.14*0.14 = 0.0196$
>Green = $0.16*0.16 = 0.0256$
>Orange = $0.2*0.2 = 0.04$
>Red = $0.13*0.13 = 0.0169$
>Yellow = $0.14*0.14 = 0.0196$
>
>Then, since we are ok if any of these events happen, we sum them together to get the final probability that any of these events happen
>$$0.0529 + 0.0196 + 0.0256 + 0.04 + 0.0169 + 0.0196$$
>Which equals 
>$$0.1746 = 17.46\%$$

#### Question 2
Use the ADFGVX cipher to encipher the following plaintext message using the grid and keyword given below. Show enough steps to receive full credits. 
**Plaintext:** to sleep perchance to dream 
**Grid:**

**Keyword:** HAMLET

>[! done] Answer for 2
>First, I need to use the provided grid to change each letter to its provided letter pair. This results in the following:
>**XF VG VA XG XX XX AV AV XX FD AF DA GD AA AF EE XF VG VX FD XX GD DD**
>
>From here, we need to place the provided into a grid created by using the keyword, then sort the letters of the keyword (each indicating a column of the grid) in alphabetic order
