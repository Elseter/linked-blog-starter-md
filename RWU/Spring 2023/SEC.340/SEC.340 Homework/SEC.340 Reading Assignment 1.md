## Questions

### Question 1.)
- What advantages do transposition ciphers offer over substitution ciphers? What advantages do substitution ciphers offer over transposition ciphers?
>[! done] Answer 1
> In a transposition cypher, the letters are simply re-arranged, like an enormous anagram. In short messages, this is somewhat insecure as there are only a few possibilities as to what the message might be. However, as the message grows longer, the number of possibilities grows at an exponential rate. While this generates an incredibly difficult to crack anagram, it unfortunately also means it is nearly impossible for your message recipient to crack as well. There must be a pattern, so your compatriot can crack the message as well. However, once this pattern is discovered, your code is broken for everyone. And there are likely less possible patterns than there are unique cyphers available to substitution.

>In a substitution cypher, each letter of plain text is substituted for a letter of cyphertext in a known order. This results in a frankly absurd number of keys depending on how you generate the cyphertext. The advantage with substitution is that letters that are not part of the message can be incorporated to further confuse code crackers. Its disadvantage is that if you start to decipher the cyphertext, either through frequency of appearance or spacing, you have essentially broken the cypher.
