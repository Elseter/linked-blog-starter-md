## Assignment
Reading Assignment #2 (Due at 8:00am on Wednesday, March 22nd): 
- Read the second chapter in the Simon Singh book (page 45-62) and answer the following questions. Reading pages: 
	- Chapter 2 – introduction, From Shunning Vigenere to the Man in the Iron Mask, The Black Chambers

### Responses
#### Question 1
For some time before the development of the Vigenère cipher, “anybody sending an encrypted message had to accept that an expert enemy codebreaker might intercept and decipher their most precious secrets.” (Singh, p. 45 introduction ) How is this environment different from the one that Mary Queen of Scots experienced, where one didn’t know how likely it was that one’s encrypted message was secure?

>[! done] Answer 1
>Mary Queen of Scots, at the time, felt confident enough to speak plainly as to her plans within encrypted text. To me, this would imply that she was confident that the messages, even if intercepted by foreign agents, would be too difficult to crack and her betrayal would remain confidential. However, for some time before the development of the Vigenère cipher, it became common place knowledge that code crackers were reliably breaking through monoalphabetic codes with ease. This meant that the more clever conspirators would both encrypt their text, and use indirect and wishy-washy language (avoiding making definitive statements) to prevent any of the material contained within these correspondences from being used against them within a court. It lead to greater discretion and probably an increases in the amount of effort that went into hiding a message as well as encrypting it. 

#### Question 2
The Great Cipher (page 55-58, before the Black Chambers) used by Louis XIV remained unbroken for 200 years. What were the factors that led to such a secure cipher?

>[! done] Answer 2
>This cypher was not only polyalphabetic, but also replaced syllabus instead of letters or small letter combinations. Additionally, the more frequently the syllabus appeared in plaintext, the more number options it could potentially be replaced with. This made frequency analysis significantly more difficult and made translation even more difficult for those not aware of the specific nuances to sylabalistic construction in the French Language This was a revolutionary approach at the time and since decryption methods were not recovered after the death of the father and son that utilized it, it took several decades until it was cracked again.

#### Question 3
Why do you think that the advent of the telegraph(page 60-63, the Black Chamber) motivated the use of a more secure cipher like the Vigenère cipher?

>[! done] Answer 3
>The telegraph allowed for easy long distance communication between two individuals. However, this also meant that the entire length of the wire was physically insecure. It was no longer possible to physical hide messages on messengers with the hope that they may not even be discovered. Additionally, telegram operators were privy to every message they would relay. Humans are fail able and could potentially be prone to bribery. So the need for secure encryption was re-introduced.
