### Commentary 
#### Women's Role in Marriage
- The view at the time, as well as the view within the novella, is that women should serve a <u>subservient</u> role in the household and should defer to their husbands opinions at all times
	- Financially
	- Creatively
	- And even in regards to their own bodies and health
- John assumes he knows whats best for his wife and completely disregards her opinions. He belittles her concerns and is quoted as "laughing at her" when she brings it up
- The author clearly disagrees and paints a potential picture of the grave consequences of robbing women of their autonomy 

#### Identity and self-expression
- The narrator desperately needs creative self expression shown in her desire to keep a private journal even though it is in direct conflict with her husbands demands for her to rest
- She craves self-expression and a creative outlet, which is stifled

#### The Rest Cure
- Since the author of the novella experienced the rest cure themselves, it is guaranteed that they have some rather strong opinions on it. 
- The narrator is also discouraged from doing activities, whether they are domestic- like cleaning or caring for her baby- in addition to things like reading, writing, and exploring the grounds of the house. 
- She is stifled and confined both physically and mentally, which only adds to her condition.

## Conclusion 
>[! conclusion] Conclusion
>Perkins Gilman damns the rest cure in this story, by showing the detrimental effects on women, and posing that women need mental and physical stimulation to be healthy, and need to be free to make their own decisions over health and their lives.
