# Socratic Dialogues
---
## Euthyphro
- Our first Socratic dialogue, in both reading and in thematic order
- Socrates is out front of the athenian courthouse where he will later stand trial when he is approached by a friend of his known as **Euthyphro**
	- Euthyphro is here at the court to prosecute a man for murder
	- ITS HIS OWN FATHER
		- His father found that one of their servants had killed another in a fit of drunken rage, he then tied this servant up and left him a ditch while he sent men to fetch the local justice
		- The murderous servant died from exposure as he was left that ditch for several days without food, water or shelter
- Socrates is shocked and wants to know how Euthyphro has the will to convict his own father
	- Euthyphro claims that his fathers actions were **unholy** in the eyes of the gods and he must seek to further justice regardless of his relation to the man
<u>Euthyphro is the Athenian prophet</u> and believes that he is confident in what is holy and unholy  
- Socrates challenges him to find a definition of holiness

This is also the introduction to <u>Socratic Irony</u>
- Irony in general, is saying one thing, while intending another (Usually just the opposite)
- Socratic Irony is often used by socrates to play up the egos and intelligences of those around him. He sometimes degrades his own intelligence and props up that of those around him in order to get answers out of them. 

### Definitions of the Holy

1. ==Holiness is what I am doing; prosecuting anyone who is guilty of murder, sacrilege, or any other familiar crime==
		- Socrates finds this a bit foolish as it is a solitary example and he wants a general definition that can be applied to any and all cases

2. ==Holiness, then, is what the gods love, and unholiness is what the gods hate==
		- Socrates also doesn't agree with this, as he believes that gods may disagree on what they find unholy and holy

3. ==Holiness is what **all** the gods love, and unholiness is what **all** the gods hate==
		- Socrates once again disagrees, he wants to trace back holiness to its source and he does not believe it originates with the gods
		- Do the Gods love something because it is holy, or is something holy because it is loved by the gods?

4. ==The holy, Socrates, appears to me to be the part of **moral rightness that attends to the gods**, as there is the other part of moral rightness which attends to men==
		- Holiness to a part of moral righteousness, but only as it relates to the gods
		- holiness to attending to the gods
		-  Socrates loops this into, do the gods benefit from attending to them
		-  If they enjoy and love the attending, then is holiness not something that gods love
		- Hence a circular argument

At this point Euthyphro is just about at the ned of his rope and is running out of definitions of holiness. Socrates has poked holes in all of his arguments. And he hastily makes up an excuse and leaves <u>Socrates with his question unanswered</u>

## Apology
- Apology is the second of our Socratic Dialogues
- Socrates is in court, <u>defending</u> himself from the charges raised by Meletus
	- He breaks down the charges into two categories, **old charges and new ones**
	- This isn't an apology, but a defense
- He is pleading his case in front of a jury of 501 Athenian men, he must acquire a majority vote to be acquitted 
	- Each side will present there case, then the jury will make a decision, afterward, if the defendant is found guilty, then each side will propose punishments and the jury will vote again

### Older Charges
#### General Info
- These are the charges that are not being officially raised by the court, but the ones that Socrates suspects are the inspiration behind why he is there 
- Socrates also believes these to be the far more **==dangerous and difficult to disprove==** of the charges
- These charges have long festered in the minds of the jury
#### Charges
- Socrates is a wise man
==- He can make the weaker argument defeat the stronger==
- He teaches others 
- He is an evil man (evil-doer)
==- He searches into things, investigates ==
#### Origin
- He must have this reputation for a reason (evil fame)
	- He will tell the jury why he suspects he has this evil reputation
	- He will explain the origin of these charges
- The **Oracle of Delphi** was asked who the wisest man was, she answered Socrates

- Socrates tried to find someone wiser than himself to prove the oracle wrong
	- He went to:
		- Politicians
		- Poets
		- Artisans
	- None of them were wiser than him, though many believed themselves to be. When Socrates realized this, he sought to correct these men on just how wise they were. 
		- It didn't go well
		- He insulted the "wise" and famous
		- Young men saw this and began to imitate Socrates
	- <u>The new charges are their revenge</u> 

### Newer Charges
#### General Info
- These are the charges being officially raised in front of the jury by Meletus and his supporters
- Meletus has already presented his arguments, we don't get to hear them, only Socrates' defense 
#### Charges
==- Socrates is a corruptor of the youth of Athens==
==- Socrates rejects the gods of the state and supplants them with his own==
- Evil-doer (again)
#### Defense
- Socrates asks who meletus believes to be the improvers of the youth
	- Socrates is their only determent/corruptor
	- If there are so many improvers of the youth, what can one 70 year old man do on his own to corrupt the youth of Athens. 
	- Socrates also call for any youth who is aggrieved with him to step forward and accuse him in front of the jury
		- None do
- Socrates then asks meletus if he simply doesn't believe in the gods or is a complete atheist
	- Meletus falls for it and call Socrates a complete atheist
	- Socrates refutes this by saying that is well known that he believes in divine activities
		- You can no believe in divine actions and matters without also believing in the divine and what is the divine if not god. 

#### Result
By a margin of only 30 jurors, Socrates is found guilty of the charges
==**Meletus proposes death as punishment**==
- Socrates is not surprised by the judgment, although he is surprised how close the decision was. He thought he would lose by a far larger margin
- Socrates proposes that they should be rewarding him instead of punishing him. 
	- Proposes that he should be rewarded with maintenance of the Prytaneum, a place that provides lodging and food for important visitors and particularly deserving citizens
- He can not endure exile, or imprisonment, so he proposes a minor fine that his friends could help him pay

**==He is found guilty again and sentenced to death==**

#### Reaction
In response, Socrates is admonishes the jury for choosing to execute a wise man and the reputation such an act would have for the state
