# A Clean Well-Lighted Place
---
## A Clean Well-Lighted Place
### General Information
- Written by Ernest Hemingway in the U.S.A, 1926
- Its a very short story (only 4 pages long)
- Hemingway's father committed suicide 
- Hemingway Shot himself in the head in his 60s
	- **Suicide was a prevalent idea in his mind from a young age**

### The Café
- The first part of this story takes place in a café set in a Spain 
	- Evidenced by the fact that the old man later uses a peseta to tip the waiters

#### The Waiters 
- Nearly the entirety of the story is a dialogue between two waiters who are working that evening at the café
	- A young waiter
	- An old waiter
- They gossip about how the old man attempted to commit suicide
	- That he attempted to do it over nothing
		- This could be interpreted as referencing the nothing at the heart of existence
		- That the old man is suffering from existential distress about nothingness

#### The Old Man
- He's deaf, but still enjoys the quiet of the café at night
- Tried to commit suicide last week
	- When asked why the waiter thinks its nothing
		- Responds that because he knows the old man has plenty of money 
		- Shows that the young waiter believes that money solves all problems 
- Soldier and Woman walk by outside 
	- The waiters expect they will bet picked up by the city guard
- Old man requests more drink
	- The waiter tells him he should have killed himself
	- Old man just asks for a little bit more

#### The Conversation
- The old man is drunk now
- Find out the old man tried to hang himself
	- His niece cut him down
	- Out of concern for the old mans soul
		- Suicide is a sin
- The older waiter empathizes with the old man
- The younger one wants him to leave so he can go home to be with his wife
	- Thinks being an old man is a disgusting thing
	- The older waiter disagrees 
>[! quote] The Older Waiter
> "Not always. This old man is clean. He drinks without spilling. Even now, drunk. Look at him."
- The old man’s humility, self-reliance, and stoicism are what make him “clean.” All three are constant virtues in Hemingway’s work, but are always paired with inner turmoil—strength despite adversity.

- The younger waiter cuts the old man off and sends him home
>[! quote] The old man's behavior
> The waiter watched him go down the street, a very old man walking unsteadily but with **dignity**.

- The younger waiter compares the older waiter to the old man
>[! done] Analysis
>They both fear the nothingness that they have at home. They fear the “shadows of leaves” (which is repeated multiple times, hinting at it’s importance) which could be a symbol for loneliness and nothingness. The both lack everything but money. The older waiter claims that he lacks “everything but work” this would mean that he lacks everything but money like the old man. (work=money)

- The café is a clean-well lighted place that allows for men like them to get away from the nothingness that they leave at home
- In our existential darkest hours, we are all searching for a clean, well-lighted place.

>[! quote] The Waiter's Prayer
>Our nada who art in nada, nada be thy name thy kingdom nada thy will be nada in nada as it is in nada. Give us this nada our daily nada and nada us our nada as we nada our nadas and nada us not into nada but deliver us from nada; pues nada. Hail nothing full of nothing, nothing is with thee. 
- By inserting the word “nada” (Spanish for nothing) for key words in the Lord’s Prayer, Hemingway’s character mocks religion and faith as empty concepts. As the story takes place in Spain (a common setting for Hemingway’s works, and rich with religious history), this “impiety” is quite ironic.

- In the end, the old waiter goes to another café and assumes the position of the old man. He becomes just another old man, desolate and alone, in need of a clean, well-lighted place
