# Persuasion

## Intro to Persuasion
### Persuasion
- A verbal and/or nonverbal process in which attributes, values, and beliefs are formed, reformed, reinforced
- **Not forced/coerced** - instead, influences listeners in a preferred manner

#### Levels of Change
##### Opinion - Attitude
- easiest to change
- IE enjoy Coke ever Pepsi
##### Belief - Trust/Faith
- more of a core belief, difficult to change
- IE Marijuana should be legalized
##### Value - Commitment
- A very important component of how people see the world
- VERY difficult to change
- be aware of what values people hold prior to attempting to influence them in any fashion
- IE Violence against women should never be permitted in marriage 

#### Goals of Persuasion
##### 1. Reinforce
- alter the intensities of agreement or disagreement
- a push in a direction
##### 2. Reform
- To change someones mind
- by far the <u>hardest form of persuasion</u>
##### 3. Form
- A person doesn't have an opinion on the subject

#### Elaboration Likelihood Model
- ELM attempts to explain how attitudes are shaped, formed, and reinforced by positive arguments
- Either think through Central Route and Peripheral Route
	##### Central Route (systematic)
	- Consider all relevant information, think about this information and then form and opinion
		- Dependent on <u>Motivation</u> and Ability
	##### Peripheral (heuristic)
	- Take mental shortcuts because motivation is low as is your ability to really think about the issue
		- Dale says X, I like Dale therefore I believe X

#### Types of Argument
##### 1. Argument by Example
	- Implicitly claiming that an example can apply 
##### 2. Argument by Analogy
	- Comparing one thing to another implying that they will be the same
	- Somewhat ignores context
##### 3. Argument by Sign
	- Connecting one sign (often observable) with another (not observable)
	- IE "Wow this restuarant is empty today, it must be losing popularity and going downhill"
##### 4. Argument by Cause
	- Wheras signs stand as something like synonyms for each other, casual inferences implicittly connect an effect to a cause
##### 5. Argument by Testimony
	- Borrow from the expertise (ethos) of others to help make our persuasive case
	- Can be individuals or organizations
	- Make sure to consider what types of biases may be present
	- Consider context (critically engage)
