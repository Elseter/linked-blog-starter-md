## How does Writing work?
- Conversation
- Genres
- To convey a message 
- Rhetorical situation
- Means of delivery
## Who Grants Authority
- Credibility
	- Cited Sources
		- How credible are those sources
	- Credentials
- Make sure sources are interwoven into the text 
## Data
- Data is collected information
- Don't use **'statistics'** if you are not prepared to describe the exact mathematical process that was used to gather data
	- Recent polls show... what polls? How many people? Where?
- Data will come to you in multiple ways
	- Charts 
	- Graphs
	- Tables
	- Numbers
## 2 styles of writing
### Academic
- lexis - how is language used
- minimal photos
	- each photo/figure is labeled and cited if necessary
	- author likely created most/all figures
	- tables/graphs are completely and properly labeled
- Everything is cited in-text w/ reference sheet
- IMRaD w/ sub-headers
### Expert/Professional
- lexis - how language is used
- lead image
- photos may or may not have author in info
- Sources may or not be provided
	- Minimal References
- Headers and sub-headers
#### Compare and Contrast
- LEXIS
- Graphics/Visuals
- FORMAT
#### Can also be compared with Thonney's "Moves"
