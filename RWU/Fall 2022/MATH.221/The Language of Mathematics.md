## Prove that the sum of 2 even integers is even
### Even Integer
- Any integer n, is defined to be even if **==n = 2k==** where k is another integer
### Odd Integer
- Any integer n, is defined to be odd if **==n = 2k + 1==** where k is another integer
### Proof
- Let m, n be even integers. They can be written as m = (2r) and n = (2k)
$$m+n = (2*r) + (2*k) = 2r+2k = 2(r+k)$$
	- The sum is the combination of two arbitrary integers times 2. This is the same as the definition of an even integer

### Intro to Set Theory
Set Definition:
- A set is a "well defined" collection of objects. These objects are called the elements of a set
- We generally use uppercase letters to indicate a set. IE, A, B

Set Notation
- If A is a set and if x is an element of A it would be written as $$ x \in A$$
- If A is a __subset__ of B if every element in A is also in B. This is denoted by $$ A \subseteq B $$
- If A is a subset of B and it is known that A and B are not the same, then A is a <u>Proper Subset</u> of B $$ A \subset B$$
### Common Sets
- Natural Numbers
		- ℕ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5,...}
- Integers
		- ℤ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
-  Rational Numbers : $$  ℚ = p/q : p,q \in ℤ , q \neq 0 $$
- Real Numbers
	- ℝ = {-∞, ∞}
- Irrational Numbers
	- = ℝ \\ ℚ

#### Example Computations
1. __Prove that__ $$ 3.14 \in \mathbb{Q} $$
		Proof: 3.14 = 314/100

2. __Prove that__  $$ 3.142142142142142 \in \mathbb{Q} $$
		Proof:  	Let x  = 3.142142... , 1000x = 3142.142142..., $$1000x - x = 3142.142142... - 3.142142... => 999x = 3139 => x = 3139/999$$

This is a test $\frac{a}{b}$
