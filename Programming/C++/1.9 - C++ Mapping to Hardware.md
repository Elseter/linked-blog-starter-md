# 1.9 - C++ Mapping to Hardware
---
## Mapping
- C++ offers a direct mapping to software
	- the implementation is what the hardware offers, typically a single machine operation
- a C++ implementation sees machine memory as a sequence of memory locations into which it can place (typed) objects and address them using [[Notes/Programming/C++/1.7 - C++ Pointers, Arrays, and References#Pointers|Pointers]] ![[C++ mapping.jpg]]
- Memory looks a lot like an [[Notes/Programming/C++/1.7 - C++ Pointers, Arrays, and References#Arrays|Array]] because an array is C++'s basic abstraction of `a contiguous sequence of objects in memory` 
>[! tip] Why C and C++ are Famous
>The mapping of fundamental language constructs to hardware is crucial for the `raw low-level performance`. This speed is why C and C++ are famous 
>- The basic machine model of C and C++ is based on computer hardware, rather than some form of mathmatics

## Assignment 
>[! code] Basic Assignment
>```cpp
>int x = 2;
>int y = 3;
>x = y;   // x becomes 3; so we get x == y
>```
	- The two objects are independent. We can change the value of y without changing the value of x after this point. This is true for all types, not just `ints`

>[! code] Pointer Assignment
>```cpp
>int x = 2;
>int y = 3;
>int* p = &x;    // int pointer p equals the address of int object x
>int* q = &y;   // int pointer q equals the address of int object y
>
>// p != q and *p != *q
>
>p = q;
>```
	- This results in both pointers being pointed at y, but does not affect x or y directly

>[! code] Reference Assignment
>```cpp
>int x = 2;
>int y = 3; 
>int& r = x;    // r refers to x
>int& r2 = y;    // r2 refers to y
>
>// read through r2, write through r: x becomes 3
>r = r2;
>```
	- To access a value pointed to by a pointer, you use `*`, that is implicit for references

## Initialization
- The task of initialization is to make a piece of uninitialized memory into a valid object
- For almost ALL types, the effect of reading and writing to memory requires for that memory to be initialized 
>[! tip] Examples
>```cpp
>int x = 7;
>int& r {x};           // bind r to x ( r refers to x)
>r  = 7;                // assign to whatever r refers to
>
>int& r2;             // error: uninitialized reference 
>r2 = 99;            // if r2 is a valid reference assign to whatever r2 refers to
>```
