## If Statement
```cpp
bool accept()
{
    // write question
    cout << "Do you want to proceed (y or n)?\n";
    // initialize to a value that will not appear on input
    char answer = 0;
    // read answer
    cin >> answer;

    if (answer == 'y' )
        return true;
    return false;
}
```
- To match the **==<< output==** operator ("Put to"), the ==**>> operator==** ("get from") is used for input
>[! def] Cin
>cin is the standard input stream

- If statements can also introduce and declare variables that only have scope for the if-statement
>[! example] If-statement declaration
>```cpp
>if (auto n = v.size(); n != 0)
>{
>// code that runs if n!=0
>}
>```
- Since 0 is evaluated as false, technically, the second part of the if statement above is unnecessary
>[! example] Shortened If statement Declaration
>```cpp
>if (auto n = v.size())
>{
>// code that runs if n != 0
>}
>```
## Switch Statement
```cpp
bool accept2()
{
    // write question
    cout << "Do you want to proceed (y or n)?\n";
    // initialize to a value that will not appear on input
    char answer = 0;
    // read answer
    cin >> answer;

    switch (answer) {
    case 'y':
        return true;
    case 'n':
        return false;
    default:
        cout << "I'll take that for a no.\n";
        return false;
    }
}
```
- a switch statement tests a value against a set of constants. Those constants, called `case-labels`, must be distinct
- If the value does not match any of them, then the default is chosen
- If we ant to exit the switch statement, we include a `break` statement within the desired case.
