# 1.4.2 - C++ Initialization

## General Initialization
>[! tip] Methods of Initialization
>```cpp
>double d1 = 2.3;
>double d2 {2.3};
>double d3 = {2.3}; // The = is optional when {} are present
>
>// a complex number with double-precision floating-point scalars
>complex\<double>z = 1;
>complex\<double>z2 {d1, d2};
>complex\<double>z3 = {d1, d3};
>
>// a vector of ints
>vector\<int> v {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};

- Ignore the \

## C compatibility 
- the = form is traditional and dates back to C
	- but if in doubt, use the general {}-list form
	- If nothing else, it saves you from conversions that lose information
>[! warning] Information Loss
>```cpp
>int i1 = 7.8; //    i1 becomes 7 as it is narrowed
>int i2 {7.8}; //   error: floating-point to integer conversion
>```
- Conversions that lose information, called **narrowing conversions** are allowed implicitly when you use = 
	- but not when you use {}
	- This is due to C compatibility

## Auto
>[! tip] Auto type
>When defining a variable, you don't need to state its type explicitly when the type can be deduced from the the initializer
>```cpp
>auto b = true; // a Boolean
>auto ch = x; // a Char
>auto i = 6; // an Int
>auto d = 1.2;  // a Double
>auto z = sqrt(y); // whatever type sqrt(y) returns
>auto bb {true}; // a Boolean
>```
- With auto we tend to use = because there is no potential problem with type conversion
	- but if you prefer to use {} consistently, you can do that instead
#### Reasons not to use Auto
- We use auto where we don't have a specific reason to mention the type explicitly 
- Specific Reasons include 
	1. The definition is in a large scope where we want to make the type clearly visible to readers of our code 
	2. The type of initialization isn't obvious 
	3. We want to be explicit about a variables range or precision
