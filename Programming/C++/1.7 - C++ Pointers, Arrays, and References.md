# 1.7 - C++ Pointers, Arrays, and References
---
## Arrays 
- The most fundamental collection of data is a contiguously allocated sequence of elements of the same type, called an `array`
- This is basically what the hardware offers 
>[! example] A Basic Array
>```cpp
>char v[6]; // an array of 6 characters with the variable name v
>```
- All arrays have `0` as their lower bound, so `v` has 6 elements, `v[0]` to `v[5]`
	- The size of an array must be a [[Notes/Programming/C++/1.6 - C++ Constants#Constant Expressions|Constant Expression]]

### Iterating through an Array
>[! tip] Methods of Iterating an Array : Part 1 ( for-statement)
>```cpp
>{
>    int v1[10] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
>
>    // print elements
>    for (auto i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
>        cout << v[i] << '\n';
>    // ...
>}
>```
	- This is a simple for loop that declares i as 0, then iterates through the list so long as i does not equal 10

>[! tip] Methods of Iterating an Array : Part 2 ( range-for-statement)
>```cpp
>int v[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
>
>//  for each x in v
>for (auto x : v)
>	cout << x << 'n';
>
>// Or even more directly
>// for each integer in the list 
>for (auto x : {10, 21 ,32, 43, 54, 65})
>	cout << x << 'n';
>```
	- This style is essential stating 'for every element in v, from first to last, place a copy in x and then print it'
	- The upside is that you don't have to specify the length or number of iterations. It can be used for any length of sequence
	- The Downside is that you are not directly changing values within the list and you do not have the variable `i` that have been used to specify the index in the past

>[! done] range for loop (altering the loop)
>```cpp
>void increment()
>{
>	int v[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
>	for (auto& x : v)
>		++x;
>}
>```
	- Here, we alter the actual members of array `v`
- In a declaration,  the unary suffix`&` means 'reference to'. A reference is similar to a pointer, except that you don't need to use a prefix `*` to access the value referred to by a reference 
## References
- References are useful when specifying function arguments. For example
```cpp 
void sort(vector<double>& v);
```
- In using a reference, we make sure that for a call like sort(my_vect), we don't copy my_vect, but alter it
	- If we don't want to modify the argument, but also don't want the cost of copying it, we use a `constant reference`
		```cpp
		double sum(const vector<double>&)
		```
## Declaratory Operators
| Operator | Example  |                                Explanation                                 |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    []    |  T a[n]  |                           a is an array of n Ts                            |
|   `*`    |  T`*`  p  |                            p is a pointer to T                             |
|   `&`    |  T`&`  r  |                           r is a reference to T                            |
|  $f(A)$  | T $f(A)$ | f is a function taking argument of type A and returning a result of type T |

## Pointers
- a pointer is a variable that stores the `memory address` as its value 
>[! example] A Basic Pointer
>```cpp
>char* p; // pointer to character
>```
- In declarations [] means "array of" and `*` means "pointer to"
- In an expression, prefix unary `*` means "contents of" and prefix unary `&` means "address of"

# The Null Pointer
>[! def] What is the Null Pointer
>When we don't have an object to point to, or if we need to represent the notion of "no object available" (such as the end of a list), we give the pointer the value `nullptr`
>- There is only one `nullptr` shared by all pointer types
