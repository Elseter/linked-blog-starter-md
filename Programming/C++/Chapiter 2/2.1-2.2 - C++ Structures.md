# 2.1-2.2 - C++ Structures

## Introduction 
>[! tip] Types of Types
>The types that can be built from the [[Notes/Programming/C++/1.4 - C++ Types and Variables#Types|Fundamental Types]], the [[Notes/Programming/C++/1.6 - C++ Constants|const modifier]] and the [[Notes/Programming/C++/1.7 - C++ Pointers, Arrays, and References#Declaratory Operators|declarative operators]] are called `built-in-types`
>- These types directly reflect the capabilities of traditional capabilities of conventional computer software
	- However, often these built-in-types don't provide the programmer with high-level facilities to write more advanced applications
### Abstraction Mechanisms
- In C++, abstraction mechanisms are primarily designed to allow programmers to design and implement their own types
>[! def] User-defined types
>User defined types are types created by individual programmers and are typically referred to as either `classes` and `enumerations`
>- They can be built of built-in-types and other user defined types

## Structures
- The first step in building a new type is often to organize the elements it needs into a data structure, called a `struct`
>[! example] Basic `struct`
>```cpp
>struct Vector {
>	double* elem;     // pointer to elements
>	int sz;          // number of elements
>}
>int main {
>	Vector v;    // a variable of type Vector could be defined 
>}
>```

### Initialization
- However, the code above won't do much, as the pointer `elem` and int `sz` are not initialized to any value besides their default
>[! example] Initializing a `struct`
>```cpp
>void vector_init(Vector& v, int s) 
>{
>	v.elem = new double[s];     // allocate an array of s doubles
>	v.sz = s;
>}
>```
- The `&` in `Vector&` indicates that we pass v by non-constant reference, that way `vector__init()` can modify the vector passed to it
	- The new operator allocates memory from an area called the free store (also known as **Dynamic Memory** and **Heap**)
>[! tip] 
>Objects allocated from the **Heap** are independent of the scope and are "live" until they are destroyed using the `delete operator`

## Example of Our Vector in Action
```cpp
// read s integers from cin and return their sum
// s is assumed to positive
double read_and_sum(int s){
	Vector v;

	// Intialize v with the proper amount of storage using init
	vector__init(v, s);

	// Read in elements from cin
	for (int i = 0; i < s; i++)
		cin >> v.elem[i];

	double sum = 0; 
	for (int i = 0; i < s; i++)
		sum += v.elem[i];

	return sum;
	
}
```
- This code will only function if the `Vector` and `vector__init` have already been defined above

### How to Access Variables stored within a `struct`
>[! example] Accessing components
>```cpp
>void f(Vector v, Vector& rv, Vector* pv)
>{
>	int i1 = v.sz;     // access through name
>	int i2 = rv.sz;    // access through reference
>	int i3 = pv->sz;  // access through pointer
>}
>```
- We use `.` (dot) to access `struct` members through a name (and through a reference) and `->` to access struct members through pointers
