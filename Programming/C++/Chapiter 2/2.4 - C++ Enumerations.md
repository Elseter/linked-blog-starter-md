# 2.4 - C++ Enumerations
---
## Enumerations
- Enumerations are a simple type of user defined type
>[! example] Example of Enumerations
>```cpp
>enum class Color { red, blue, green };
>enum class Traffic_light { green, yellow, red };
>
>Color col = Color::red;
>Traffic_light = Traffic_light::red;
>```
- the enumerators are in the scope of their `enum` class
	- `Color::red` is different from `Traffic_light::red`
>[! tip]
>Enumerations are used to represent small sets of integer values. 
>- They are used to make code more readable and less error-prone than it would have been had their symbolic enumerator names were not used

>[! example] Cannot mix `enum` values
