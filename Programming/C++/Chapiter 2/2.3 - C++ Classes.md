## Classes
>[! Def] What is a Class
>We often want to keep the representation inaccessible to users so as to simplify use, guarantee consistent use of the data, and allow us to later improve the representation. To do that, we have to distinguish between the interface to a type (to be used by all) and its implementation (which has access to the otherwise inaccessible data). The language mechanism for that is called a class.
>- A class has a set of `members` which can be data, function, or type members
- The interface of a class is defined by its `public` and `private` members
	- Conventionally, we place the public declarations first and the private declarations later, except when we want to emphasize the representation

### Defining
>[! example] Vector Class
>```cpp
>class Vector{
>public:
>
>	// Construct a Vector
>	Vector(int s) : elem{new double[s]}, sz{s} { }
>	
>	// element access : Subscripting
>	double& operator[](int i) {return elem[i];}
>	
>	int size() {return sz;}
>	
>private:
>	double* elem;    // pointer to the elements
>	int sz;        // number of the elements
>}
>```
- Now, with the class defined, we can define a variable of our new type Vector
>[! example] Vector Definition
>```cpp
>Vector v(6);  // a Vector with 6 elements 
>```

- The vector object itself, will always be the same size
	- This results in a **`fixed size handle`** referring to a variable amount of data
		- This variable data is allocated on the **Heap**
#### Constructor
- a member function with the same name as the class is known as a **Constructor**
	- This replaces `vector__init()` from [[2.1-2.2 - C++ Structures#Structures|struct]] 
>[! example] Initializing components of a class
>```cpp
>Vector(int s) : elem{new double[s]}, sz{s} {}
>```
- First we initialize `elem` with a pointer to `s` elements of a type `double` obtained from the free store with the use of the `new` 
	- Then we initialize `sz` to `s`
#### Subscripting
>[! example] Subscript
>```cpp
>double& operator[](int i) {return elem[i];}
>```
- Here, we define how when the operator `[]` is used.
	- It returns a reference to the appropriate element (using `double&` to allow for both reading and writing)
### Utilizing a Class
```cpp
double read_and_sum(int s){

    // Create a vector with a size of s
    Vector v(s);

    // read into elements
    for (int i = 0; i<v.size(); i++)
        cin >> v[i];

    // sum elements
    double sum=0;
    for (int i = 0; i<v.size(); i++)
        sum += v[i];

    return sum;

}
```
## Important Note
>[! tip] struct V.S class
>There is no fundamental difference between a [[2.1-2.2 - C++ Structures#Structures|struct]] and a [[2.3 - C++ Classes|class]]; a `struct` is simply a `class` with members `public` by default. For example, you can define constructors and other member functions for a `struct`.
